<h2><a name="ABRAHAM_LINCOLN" id="ABRAHAM_LINCOLN"></a>ABRAHAM LINCOLN<br />

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Biographical Sketch</span></span></h2>

<p>In a little log-cabin in Hardin County, Kentucky,
on the 12th of February, 1809, was born
a future President of the United States, Abraham
Lincoln.</p>

<p>When Abraham was seven years old, his father,
Thomas Lincoln, moved with his family to Indiana.
It was a cold, dreary winter for them
in the rude shed which Abraham, knowing well
how to handle an ax, had helped his father to
build. The following autumn found them in a
better cabin, but brought to Abraham the loss of
his mother, Nancy Hanks Lincoln, leaving his sister
Sarah, eleven years old, to care for the household.
But the next year the little home was much
changed; for a stepmother had come, a woman of
energy and thrift, who provided the children with
comforts before unknown to them. She became
very fond of Abraham and encouraged his inclination
for reading and study. One year would
probably cover all the schooling he ever had, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span>
he set to work with a will to educate himself,
sometimes walking miles to borrow a book.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1830 Thomas Lincoln sold his
farm in Indiana and moved to Illinois. Abraham,
though wishing to do something for himself, remained
with his father about a year longer, to see
him comfortably settled in his new home. Then,
in April, he went on his second expedition to New
Orleans in a flatboat. On his return his employer
placed him in charge of a store at New Salem.</p>

<p>When he was twenty-three years old, he enlisted
in what was called the Black Hawk War, and was
chosen captain of his company. When the war
was at an end and he returned home, he was told
that the people wished to send him to the legislature.
He agreed to be a candidate, but was not
elected. All this time he did not give up the idea
of becoming a lawyer, and soon after the next
election, at which he received a large majority, he
commenced the study of law.</p>

<p>In 1837 he left New Salem and removed to
Springfield, which was ever after his home. He
was elected to the Illinois legislature four times in
succession and again in 1846, and the following
year he was chosen to be a Representative in Congress.
At the close of his two years in Congress,
Mr. Lincoln returned to Springfield and applied
himself to the practice of law. But very soon he
was again taking an active part in the politics of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">xi</a></span>
his State. It was at the State convention held in
Bloomington in 1856, at which time the Republican
party of Illinois was finally organized, that
Mr. Lincoln made the wonderful address which
has become famous as his “lost speech.”</p>

<p>Eighteen fifty-eight was the year of the noted
Lincoln-Douglas Debate that brought Mr. Lincoln
conspicuously before the whole country. Two
years later, when visiting New York, he was invited
by a party of Republicans to deliver a
speech at Cooper Union. This speech helped to
increase his popularity. This same year, 1860,
Mr. Lincoln was elected to be President of the
United States, and on the 4th of March, 1861,
delivered his First Inaugural Address in the presence
of thousands of people. The Emancipation
Proclamation, which gave the slaves their freedom,
was issued to take effect on the 1st of January,
1863; and in this act Mr. Lincoln made his
name great. It was in this same year that he
delivered the famous Gettysburg Address.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln was elected to the Presidency for
the second term, but lived only a few weeks afterward.
He was shot in a theater in Washington
on Friday evening, the 14th of April, 1865.</p>

<h2><a name="COOPER_INSTITUTE_SPEECH" id="COOPER_INSTITUTE_SPEECH"></a>COOPER INSTITUTE SPEECH</h2>

<p class="p2 b2 center">DELIVERED AT COOPER INSTITUTE, NEW YORK,
FEBRUARY 27, 1860</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President and Fellow-Citizens of
New York</span>:&mdash;The facts with which I shall deal
this evening are mainly old and familiar; nor is
there anything new in the general use I shall make
of them. If there shall be any novelty, it will be
in the mode of presenting the facts, and the inferences
and observations following that presentation.
In his speech last autumn at Columbus,
Ohio, as reported in the New York <i>Times</i>, Senator
Douglas said: “Our fathers, when they framed
the government under which we live, understood
this question just as well, and even better, than we
do now.”</p>

<p>I fully indorse this, and I adopt it as a text
for this discourse. I so adopt it because it furnishes
a precise and an agreed starting-point for
a discussion between Republicans and that wing
of the Democracy headed by Senator Douglas. It
simply leaves the inquiry: What was the understanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
those fathers had of the question mentioned?</p>

<p>What is the frame of government under which
we live? The answer must be, “The Constitution
of the United States.” That Constitution
consists of the original, framed in 1787, and under
which the present government first went into
operation, and twelve subsequently framed amendments,
the first ten of which were framed in 1789.</p>

<p>Who were our fathers that framed the Constitution?
I suppose the “thirty-nine” who
signed the original instrument may be fairly called
our fathers who framed that part of the present
government. It is almost exactly true to say they
framed it, and it is altogether true to say they
fairly represented the opinion and sentiment of
the whole nation at that time. Their names, being
familiar to nearly all, and accessible to quite
all, need not now be repeated.</p>

<p>I take these “thirty-nine,” for the present, as
being “our fathers who framed the government
under which we live.” What is the question
which, according to the text, those fathers understood
“just as well, and even better, than we do
now”?</p>

<p>It is this: Does the proper division of local
from Federal authority, or anything in the Constitution,
forbid our Federal Government to control
as to slavery in our Federal Territories?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
Upon this, Senator Douglas holds the affirmative,
and Republicans the negative. This affirmation
and denial form an issue; and this issue&mdash;this
question&mdash;is precisely what the text declares
our fathers understood “better than we.”
Let us now inquire whether the “thirty-nine,” or
any of them, ever acted upon this question; and
if they did, how they acted upon it&mdash;how they expressed
that better understanding. In 1784, three
years before the Constitution, the United States
then owning the Northwestern Territory and no
other, the Congress of the Confederation had before
them the question of prohibiting slavery in
that Territory; and four of the “thirty-nine”
who afterward framed the Constitution were in
that Congress, and voted on that question. Of
these, Roger Sherman, Thomas Mifflin, and Hugh
Williamson voted for the prohibition, thus showing
that, in their understanding, no line dividing
local from Federal authority, nor anything else,
properly forbade the Federal Government to control
as to slavery in Federal territory. The other
of the four, James McHenry, voted against the
prohibition, showing that for some cause he
thought it improper to vote for it.</p>

<p>In 1787, still before the Constitution, but while
the convention was in session framing it, and while
the Northwestern Territory still was the only Territory
owned by the United States, the same question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
of prohibiting slavery in the Territory again
came before the Congress of the Confederation;
and two more of the “thirty-nine” who afterward
signed the Constitution were in that Congress,
and voted on the question. They were William
Blount and William Few; and they both
voted for the prohibition&mdash;thus showing that in
their understanding no line dividing local from
Federal authority, nor anything else, properly
forbade the Federal Government to control as to
slavery in Federal territory. This time the prohibition
became a law, being part of what is now
well known as the ordinance of ’87.</p>

<p>The question of Federal control of slavery in
the Territories seems not to have been directly
before the convention which framed the original
Constitution; and hence it is not recorded that the
“thirty-nine” or any of them, while engaged on
that instrument, expressed any opinion on that
precise question.</p>

<p>In 1789, by the first Congress which sat under
the Constitution, an act was passed to enforce
the ordinance of ’87, including the prohibition of
slavery in the Northwestern Territory. The bill
for this act was reported by one of the “thirty-nine”&mdash;Thomas
Fitzsimmons, then a member of
the House of Representatives from Pennsylvania.
It went through all its stages without a word of
opposition, and finally passed both branches without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
ayes and nays, which is equivalent to a unanimous
passage. In this Congress there were sixteen
of the thirty-nine fathers who framed the
original Constitution. They were John Langdon,
Nicholas Gilman, William S. Johnson, Roger
Sherman, Robert Morris, Thomas Fitzsimmons,
William Few, Abraham Baldwin, Rufus King,
William Paterson, George Clymer, Richard Bassett,
George Read, Pierce Butler, Daniel Carroll,
and James Madison.</p>

<p>This shows that, in their understanding, no line
dividing local from Federal authority, nor anything
in the Constitution, properly forbade Congress
to prohibit slavery in the Federal territory;
else both their fidelity to correct principle, and their
oath to support the Constitution, would have constrained
them to oppose the prohibition.</p>

<p>Again, George Washington, another of the
“thirty-nine,” was then President of the United
States, and as such approved and signed the bill,
thus completing its validity as a law, and thus
showing that, in his understanding, no line dividing
local from Federal authority, nor anything in
the Constitution, forbade the Federal Government
to control as to slavery in Federal territory.</p>

<p>No great while after the adoption of the original
Constitution, North Carolina ceded to the
Federal Government the country now constituting
the State of Tennessee; and a few years later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
Georgia ceded that which now constitutes the
States of Mississippi and Alabama. In both deeds
of cession it was made a condition by the ceding
States that the Federal Government should not
prohibit slavery in the ceded country. Besides
this, slavery was then actually in the ceded country.
Under these circumstances, Congress, on
taking charge of these countries, did not absolutely
prohibit slavery within them. But they did
interfere with it&mdash;take control of it&mdash;even there,
to a certain extent. In 1798 Congress organized
the Territory of Mississippi. In the act of organization
they prohibited the bringing of slaves into
the Territory from any place without the United
States, by fine, and giving freedom to slaves so
brought. This act passed both branches of Congress
without yeas and nays. In that Congress
were three of the “thirty-nine” who framed the
original Constitution. They were John Langdon,
George Read, and Abraham Baldwin. They all
probably voted for it. Certainly they would have
placed their opposition to it upon record if, in
their understanding, any line dividing local from
Federal authority, or anything in the Constitution,
properly forbade the Federal Government to control
as to slavery in Federal territory.</p>

<p>In 1803 the Federal Government purchased the
Louisiana country. Our former territorial acquisitions
came from certain of our own States; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
this Louisiana country was acquired from a foreign
nation. In 1804 Congress gave a territorial
organization to that part of it which now constitutes
the State of Louisiana. New Orleans, lying
within that part, was an old and comparatively
large city. There were other considerable towns
and settlements, and slavery was extensively and
thoroughly intermingled with the people. Congress
did not, in the Territorial Act, prohibit slavery;
but they did interfere with it&mdash;take control of
it&mdash;in a more marked and extensive way than they
did in the case of Mississippi. The substance of
the provision therein made in relation to slaves
was:</p>

<p>1st. That no slave should be imported into the
Territory from foreign parts.</p>

<p>2d. That no slave should be carried into it who
had been imported into the United States since the
first day of May, 1798.</p>

<p>3d. That no slave should be carried into it,
except by the owner, and for his own use as a settler;
the penalty in all the cases being a fine upon
the violator of the law, and freedom to the slave.</p>

<p>This act also was passed without ayes or nays.
In the Congress which passed it there were two of
the “thirty-nine.” They were Abraham Baldwin
and Jonathan Dayton. As stated in the case of
Mississippi, it is probable they both voted for it.
They would not have allowed it to pass without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
recording their opposition to it if, in their understanding,
it violated either the line properly dividing
local from Federal authority, or any provision
of the Constitution.</p>

<p>In 1819&ndash;20 came and passed the Missouri question.
Many votes were taken, by yeas and nays,
in both branches of Congress, upon the various
phases of the general question. Two of the
“thirty-nine”&mdash;Rufus King and Charles Pinckney&mdash;were
members of that Congress. Mr. King
steadily voted for slavery prohibition and against
all compromises, while Mr. Pinckney as steadily
voted against slavery prohibition and against all
compromises. By this, Mr. King showed that, in
his understanding, no line dividing local from Federal
authority, nor anything in the Constitution,
was violated by Congress prohibiting slavery in
Federal territory; while Mr. Pinckney, by his
votes, showed that, in his understanding, there
was some sufficient reason for opposing such prohibition
in that case.</p>

<p>The cases I have mentioned are the only acts
of the “thirty-nine,” or of any of them, upon
the direct issue, which I have been able to discover.</p>

<p>To enumerate the persons who thus acted as
being four in 1784, two in 1787, seventeen in
1789, three in 1798, two in 1804, and two in
1819&ndash;20, there would be thirty of them. But this
would be counting John Langdon, Roger Sherman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
William Few, Rufus King, and George Read
each twice, and Abraham Baldwin three times.
The true number of those of the “thirty-nine”
whom I have shown to have acted upon the question
which, by the text, they understood better
than we, is twenty-three, leaving sixteen not shown
to have acted upon it in any way.</p>

<p>Here, then, we have twenty-three out of our
thirty-nine fathers “who framed the government
under which we live,” who have, upon their official
responsibility and their corporal oaths, acted
upon the very question which the text affirms they
“understood just as well, and even better, than we
do now”; and twenty-one of them&mdash;a clear majority
of the whole “thirty-nine”&mdash;so acting upon
it as to make them guilty of gross political impropriety
and willful perjury if, in their understanding,
any proper division between local and Federal
authority, or anything in the Constitution
they had made themselves, and sworn to support,
forbade the Federal Government to control as to
slavery in the Federal Territories. Thus the
twenty-one acted; and, as actions speak louder
than words, so actions under such responsibility
speak still louder.</p>

<p>Two of the twenty-three voted against congressional
prohibition of slavery in the Federal Territories,
in the instances in which they acted upon
the question. But for what reasons they so voted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
is not known. They may have done so because
they thought a proper division of local from Federal
authority, or some provision or principle of
the Constitution, stood in the way; or they may,
without any such question, have voted against the
prohibition on what appeared to them to be sufficient
grounds of expediency. No one who has
sworn to support the Constitution can conscientiously
vote for what he understands to be an unconstitutional
measure, however expedient he may
think it; but one may and ought to vote against
a measure which he deems constitutional if, at
the same time, he deems it inexpedient. It, therefore,
would be unsafe to set down even the two
who voted against the prohibition as having done
so because, in their understanding, any proper
division of local from Federal authority, or anything
in the Constitution, forbade the Federal
Government to control as to slavery in Federal
territory.</p>

<p>The remaining sixteen of the “thirty-nine,” so
far as I have discovered, have left no record of
their understanding upon the direct question of
Federal control of slavery in the Federal Territories.
But there is much reason to believe that
their understanding upon that question would not
have appeared different from that of their twenty-three
compeers, had it been manifested at all.</p>

<p>For the purpose of adhering rigidly to the text,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
I have purposely omitted whatever understanding
may have been manifested by any person, however
distinguished, other than the thirty-nine fathers,
who framed the original Constitution; and, for
the same reason, I have also omitted whatever understanding
may have been manifested by any of
the “thirty-nine” even on any other phase of
the general question of slavery. If we should look
into their acts and declarations on those other
phases, as the foreign slave-trade, and the morality
and policy of slavery generally, it would appear
to us that on the direct question of Federal control
of slavery in Federal Territories, the sixteen,
if they had acted at all, would probably
have acted just as the twenty-three did. Among
that sixteen were several of the most noted anti-slavery
men of those times,&mdash;as Dr. Franklin,
Alexander Hamilton, and Gouverneur Morris,&mdash;while
there was not one now known to have been
otherwise, unless it may be John Rutledge, of
South Carolina.</p>

<p>The sum of the whole is, that of our thirty-nine
fathers who framed the original Constitution,
twenty-one&mdash;a clear majority of the whole&mdash;certainly
understood that no proper division of
local from Federal authority, nor any part of the
Constitution, forbade the Federal Government to
control slavery in the Federal Territories; while
all the rest had probably the same understanding.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
Such, unquestionably, was the understanding of
our fathers who framed the original Constitution;
and the text affirms that they understood the question
“better than we.”</p>

<p>But, so far, I have been considering the understanding
of the question manifested by the framers
of the original Constitution. In and by the original
instrument, a mode was provided for amending
it; and, as I have already stated, the present
frame of “the government under which we live”
consists of that original, and twelve amendatory
articles framed and adopted since. Those who
now insist that Federal control of slavery in Federal
Territories violates the Constitution, point us
to the provisions which they suppose it thus violates;
and, as I understand, they all fix upon provisions
in these amendatory articles, and not in
the original instrument. The Supreme Court, in
the Dred Scott case, plant themselves upon the
fifth amendment, which provides that no person
shall be deprived of “life, liberty, or property
without due process of law”; while Senator Douglas
and his peculiar adherents plant themselves
upon the tenth amendment, providing that “the
powers not delegated to the United States by the
Constitution” “are reserved to the States respectively,
or to the people.”</p>

<p>Now, it so happens that these amendments were
framed by the first Congress which sat under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
Constitution&mdash;the identical Congress which passed
the act, already mentioned, enforcing the prohibition
of slavery in the Northwestern Territory.
Not only was it the same Congress, but they were
the identical, same individual men who, at the
same session, and at the same time within the session,
had under consideration, and in progress toward
maturity, these constitutional amendments,
and this act prohibiting slavery in all the territory
the nation then owned. The constitutional
amendments were introduced before, and passed
after, the act enforcing the ordinance of ’87; so
that, during the whole pendency of the act to enforce
the ordinance, the constitutional amendments
were also pending.</p>

<p>The seventy-six members of that Congress, including
sixteen of the framers of the original Constitution,
as before stated, were pre-eminently our
fathers who framed that part of “the government
under which we live” which is now claimed as forbidding
the Federal Government to control slavery
in the Federal Territories.</p>

<p>Is it not a little presumptuous in anyone at this
day to affirm that the two things which that Congress
deliberately framed and carried to maturity
at the same time, are absolutely inconsistent with
each other? And does not such affirmation become
impudently absurd when coupled with the
other affirmation from the same mouth, that those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
who did the two things alleged to be inconsistent,
understood whether they really were inconsistent
better than we&mdash;better than he who affirms that
they are inconsistent?</p>

<p>It is surely safe to assume that the thirty-nine
framers of the original Constitution, and the seventy-six
members of the Congress which framed
the amendments thereto, taken together, do certainly
include those who may be fairly called “our
fathers who framed the government under which
we live.” And so assuming, I defy any man to
show that any one of them ever, in his whole life,
declared that, in his understanding, any proper
division of local from Federal authority, or any
part of the Constitution, forbade the Federal Government
to control as to slavery in the Federal
Territories. I go a step further. I defy anyone
to show that any living man in the whole world
ever did, prior to the beginning of the present century
(and I might almost say prior to the beginning
of the last half of the present century), declare
that, in his understanding, any proper division
of local from Federal authority, or any part
of the Constitution, forbade the Federal Government
to control as to slavery in the Federal Territories.
To those who now so declare I give not
only “our fathers who framed the government
under which we live,” but with them all other living
men within the century in which it was framed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
among whom to search, and they shall not be able
to find the evidence of a single man agreeing with
them.</p>

<p>Now, and here, let me guard a little against being
misunderstood. I do not mean to say we are
bound to follow implicitly in whatever our fathers
did. To do so would be to discard all the lights
of current experience&mdash;to reject all progress, all
improvement. What I do say is that, if we would
supplant the opinions and policy of our fathers in
any case, we should do so upon evidence so conclusive,
and argument so clear, that even their
great authority, fairly considered and weighed,
cannot stand; and most surely not in a case whereof
we ourselves declare they understood the question
better than we.</p>

<p>If any man at this day sincerely believes that
a proper division of local from Federal authority,
or any part of the Constitution, forbids the Federal
Government to control as to slavery in the
Federal Territories, he is right to say so, and to
enforce his position by all truthful evidence and
fair argument which he can. But he has no right
to mislead others, who have less access to history,
and less leisure to study it, into the false belief
that “our fathers who framed the government under
which we live” were of the same opinion&mdash;thus
substituting falsehood and deception for
truthful evidence and fair argument. If any man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
at this day sincerely believes “our fathers who
framed the government under which we live” used
and applied principles, in other cases, which ought
to have led them to understand that a proper division
of local from Federal authority, or some part
of the Constitution, forbids the Federal Government
to control as to slavery in the Federal Territories,
he is right to say so. But he should, at
the same time, brave the responsibility of declaring
that, in his opinion, he understands their principles
better than they did themselves; and especially
should he not shirk that responsibility by
asserting that they “understood the question just
as well, and even better, than we do now.”</p>

<p>But enough! Let all who believe that “our fathers
who framed the government under which we
live understood this question just as well, and even
better, than we do now,” speak as they spoke, and
act as they acted upon it. This is all Republicans
ask&mdash;all Republicans desire&mdash;in relation to slavery.
As those fathers marked it, so let it be again
marked, as an evil not to be extended, but to be
tolerated and protected only because of and so far
as its actual presence among us makes that toleration
and protection a necessity. Let all the guarantees
those fathers gave it be not grudgingly, but
fully and fairly, maintained. For this Republicans
contend, and with this, so far as I know or believe,
they will be content.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
And now, if they would listen,&mdash;as I suppose
they will not,&mdash;I would address a few words to
the Southern people.</p>

<p>I would say to them: You consider yourselves a
reasonable and a just people; and I consider that
in the general qualities of reason and justice you
are not inferior to any other people. Still, when
you speak of us Republicans, you do so only to
denounce us as reptiles, or, at the best, as no better
than outlaws. You will grant a hearing to
pirates or murderers, but nothing like it to “Black
Republicans.” In all your contentions with one
another, each of you deems an unconditional condemnation
of “Black Republicanism” as the first
thing to be attended to. Indeed, such condemnation
of us seems to be an indispensable prerequisite&mdash;license,
so to speak&mdash;among you to be admitted
or permitted to speak at all. Now can you or not
be prevailed upon to pause and to consider whether
this is quite just to us, or even to yourselves?
Bring forward your charges and specifications, and
then be patient long enough to hear us deny or
justify.</p>

<p>You say we are sectional. We deny it. That
makes an issue; and the burden of proof is upon
you. You produce your proof; and what is it?
Why, that our party has no existence in your section&mdash;gets
no votes in your section. The fact is
substantially true; but does it prove the issue? If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
it does, then in case we should, without change of
principle, begin to get votes in your section, we
should thereby cease to be sectional. You cannot
escape this conclusion; and yet are you willing to
abide by it? If you are, you will probably soon
find that we have ceased to be sectional, for we
shall get votes in your section this very year. You
will then begin to discover, as the truth plainly is,
that your proof does not touch the issue. The
fact that we get no votes in your section is a fact of
your making, and not of ours. And if there be
fault in that fact, that fault is primarily yours,
and remains so until you show that we repel you
by some wrong principle or practice. If we do repel
you by any wrong principle or practice, the fault
is ours; but this brings you to where you ought to
have started&mdash;to a discussion of the right or
wrong of our principle. If our principle, put in
practice, would wrong your section for the benefit
of ours, or for any other object, then our principle,
and we with it, are sectional, and are justly opposed
and denounced as such. Meet us, then, on
the question of whether our principle, put in practice,
would wrong your section; and so meet us as
if it were possible that something may be said
on our side. Do you accept the challenge? No!
Then you really believe that the principle which
“our fathers who framed the government under
which we live” thought so clearly right as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
adopt it, and indorse it again and again, upon their
official oaths, is in fact so clearly wrong as to demand
your condemnation without a moment’s
consideration.</p>

<p>Some of you delight to flaunt in our faces the
warning against sectional parties given by Washington
in his Farewell Address. Less than eight
years before Washington gave that warning, he
had, as President of the United States, approved
and signed an act of Congress enforcing the prohibition
of slavery in the Northwestern Territory,
which act embodied the policy of the government
upon that subject up to and at the very moment
he penned that warning; and about one year after
he penned it, he wrote Lafayette that he considered
that prohibition a wise measure, expressing
in the same connection his hope that we should at
some time have a confederacy of free States.</p>

<p>Bearing this in mind, and seeing that sectionalism
has since arisen upon this same subject, is
that warning a weapon in your hands against us,
or in our hands against you? Could Washington
himself speak, would he cast the blame of that sectionalism
upon us, who sustain his policy, or upon
you, who repudiate it? We respect that warning
of Washington, and we commend it to you, together
with his example pointing to the right application
of it.</p>

<p>But you say you are conservative&mdash;eminently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
conservative&mdash;while we are revolutionary, destructive,
or something of the sort. What is conservatism?
Is it not adherence to the old and
tried, against the new and untried? We stick to,
contend for, the identical old policy on the point
in controversy which was adopted by “our fathers
who framed the government under which
we live”; while you with one accord reject, and
scout, and spit upon that old policy, and insist
upon substituting something new. True, you disagree
among yourselves as to what that substitute
shall be. You are divided on new propositions
and plans, but you are unanimous in rejecting and
denouncing the old policy of the fathers. Some
of you are for reviving the foreign slave-trade;
some for a congressional slave code for the Territories;
some for Congress forbidding the Territories
to prohibit slavery within their limits; some
for maintaining slavery in the Territories through
the judiciary; some for the “gur-reat pur-rinciple”
that “if one man would enslave another, no third
man should object,” fantastically called “popular
sovereignty”; but never a man among you is in
favor of Federal prohibition of slavery in Federal
Territories, according to the practice of “our fathers
who framed the government under which we
live.” Not one of all your various plans can show
a precedent or an advocate in the century within
which our government originated. Consider, then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
whether your claim of conservatism for yourselves,
and your charge of destructiveness against us, are
based on the most clear and stable foundation.</p>

<p>Again, you say we have made the slavery question
more prominent than it formerly was. We
deny it. We admit that it is more prominent, but
we deny that we made it so. It was not we, but
you, who discarded the old policy of the fathers.
We resisted, and still resist, your innovation; and
thence comes the greater prominence of the question.
Would you have that question reduced to
its former proportions? Go back to that old policy.
What has been will be again, under the same
conditions. If you would have the peace of the
old times, readopt the precepts and policy of the
old times.</p>

<p>You charge that we stir up insurrections among
your slaves. We deny it; and what is your proof?
Harper’s Ferry! John Brown! John Brown was
no Republican; and you have failed to implicate
a single Republican in his Harper’s Ferry enterprise.
If any member of our party is guilty in
that matter you know it, or you do not know it.
If you do know it, you are inexcusable for not
designating the man and proving the fact. If
you do not know it, you are inexcusable for asserting
it, and especially for persisting in the
assertion after you have tried and failed to make
the proof. You need not be told that persisting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
in a charge which one does not know to be true,
is simply malicious slander.</p>

<p>Some of you admit that no Republican designedly
aided or encouraged the Harper’s Ferry affair,
but still insist that our doctrines and declarations
necessarily lead to such results. We do
not believe it. We know we hold no doctrine, and
make no declaration, which were not held to and
made by “our fathers who framed the government
under which we live.” You never dealt
fairly by us in relation to this affair. When it
occurred, some important State elections were near
at hand, and you were in evident glee with the
belief that, by charging the blame upon us, you
could get an advantage of us in those elections.
The elections came, and your expectations were
not quite fulfilled. Every Republican man knew
that, as to himself at least, your charge was a
slander, and he was not much inclined by it to
cast his vote in your favor. Republican doctrines
and declarations are accompanied with a continual
protest against any interference whatever with
your slaves, or with you about your slaves. Surely
this does not encourage them to revolt. True, we
do, in common with “our fathers who framed the
government under which we live,” declare our belief
that slavery is wrong; but the slaves do not
hear us declare even this. For anything we say
or do, the slaves would scarcely know there is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
Republican party. I believe they would not, in
fact, generally know it but for your misrepresentations
of us in their hearing. In your political contests
among yourselves, each faction charges the
other with sympathy with Black Republicanism;
and then, to give point to the charge, defines Black
Republicanism to simply be insurrection, blood,
and thunder among the slaves.</p>

<p>Slave insurrections are no more common now
than they were before the Republican party was
organized. What induced the Southampton insurrection,
twenty-eight years ago, in which at
least three times as many lives were lost as at Harper’s
Ferry? You can scarcely stretch your very
elastic fancy to the conclusion that Southampton
was “got up by Black Republicanism.” In the
present state of things in the United States, I do
not think a general, or even a very extensive, slave
insurrection is possible. The indispensable concert
of action cannot be attained. The slaves have no
means of rapid communication; nor can incendiary
freemen, black or white, supply it. The explosive
materials are everywhere in parcels; but there
neither are, nor can be supplied, the indispensable
connecting trains.</p>

<p>Much is said by Southern people about the affection
of slaves for their masters and mistresses;
and a part of it, at least, is true. A plot for an
uprising could scarcely be devised and communicated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
to twenty individuals before some one of
them, to save the life of a favorite master or mistress,
would divulge it. This is the rule; and the
slave revolution in Hayti was not an exception
to it, but a case occurring under peculiar circumstances.
The gunpowder plot of British history,
though not connected with slaves, was more in
point. In that case only about twenty were admitted
to the secret; and yet one of them, in his
anxiety to save a friend, betrayed the plot to that
friend, and, by consequence, averted the calamity.
Occasional poisonings from the kitchen and open
or stealthy assassinations in the field, and local revolts
extending to a score or so, will continue to
occur as the natural results of slavery; but no general
insurrections of slaves, as I think, can happen
in this country for a long time. Whoever
much fears, or much hopes, for such an event, will
be alike disappointed.</p>

<p>In the language of Mr. Jefferson, uttered many
years ago, “It is still in our power to direct the
process of emancipation and deportation peaceably,
and in such slow degrees, as that the evil will
wear off insensibly; and their places be, <i>pari passu</i>,
filled up by free white laborers. If, on the contrary,
it is left to force itself on, human nature
must shudder at the prospect held up.”</p>

<p>Mr. Jefferson did not mean to say, nor do I,
that the power of emancipation is in the Federal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
Government. He spoke of Virginia; and, as to
the power of emancipation, I speak of the slaveholding
States only. The Federal Government,
however, as we insist, has the power of restraining
the extension of the institution&mdash;the power to insure
that a slave insurrection shall never occur on
any American soil which is now free from slavery.</p>

<p>John Brown’s effort was peculiar. It was not
a slave insurrection. It was an attempt by white
men to get up a revolt among slaves, in which the
slaves refused to participate. In fact, it was so
absurd that the slaves, with all their ignorance,
saw plainly enough it could not succeed. That affair,
in its philosophy, corresponds with the many
attempts, related in history, at the assassination of
kings and emperors. An enthusiast broods over
the oppression of a people till he fancies himself
commissioned by Heaven to liberate them. He
ventures the attempt, which ends in little else than
his own execution. Orsini’s attempt on Louis Napoleon
and John Brown’s attempt at Harper’s
Ferry were, in their philosophy, precisely the same.
The eagerness to cast blame on old England in the
one case and on New England in the other, does
not disprove the sameness of the two things.</p>

<p>And how much would it avail you, if you could,
by the use of John Brown, Helper’s Book, and the
like, break up the Republican organization? Human
action can be modified to some extent, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
human nature cannot be changed. There is a
judgment and a feeling against slavery in this nation
which cast at least a million and a half of
votes. You cannot destroy that judgment and
feeling&mdash;that sentiment&mdash;by breaking up the political
organization which rallies around it. You
can scarcely scatter and disperse an army which
has been formed into order in the face of your
heaviest fire; but if you could, how much would
you gain by forcing the sentiment which created
it out of the peaceful channel of the ballot-box into
some other channel? What would that other
channel probably be? Would the number of John
Browns be lessened or enlarged by the operation?</p>

<p>But you will break up the Union rather than
submit to a denial of your constitutional rights.</p>

<p>That has a somewhat reckless sound; but it
would be palliated, if not fully justified, were we
proposing, by the mere force of numbers, to deprive
you of some right plainly written down in
the Constitution. But we are proposing no such
thing.</p>

<p>When you make these declarations, you have a
specific and well-understood allusion to an assumed
constitutional right of yours to take slaves into
the Federal Territories, and to hold them there as
property. But no such right is specifically written
in the Constitution. That instrument is literally
silent about any such right. We, on the contrary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
deny that such a right has any existence in the Constitution,
even by implication.</p>

<p>Your purpose, then, plainly stated, is that you
will destroy the government, unless you be allowed
to construe and force the Constitution as you
please, on all points in dispute between you and
us. You will rule or ruin in all events.</p>

<p>This, plainly stated, is your language. Perhaps
you will say the Supreme Court has decided
the disputed constitutional question in your favor.
Not quite so. But waiving the lawyer’s distinction
between dictum and decision, the court has decided
the question for you in a sort of way. The court
has substantially said, it is your constitutional right
to take slaves into the Federal Territories, and to
hold them there as property. When I say the decision
was made in a sort of way, I mean it was
made in a divided court, by a bare majority of
the judges, and they not quite agreeing with one
another in the reasons for making it; that it is so
made that its avowed supporters disagree with one
another about its meaning, and that it was mainly
based upon a mistaken statement of fact&mdash;the
statement in the opinion that “the right of property
in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed
in the Constitution.”</p>

<p>An inspection of the Constitution will show that
the right of property in a slave is not “distinctly
and expressly affirmed” in it. Bear in mind, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
judges do not pledge their judicial opinion that
such right is impliedly affirmed in the Constitution;
but they pledge their veracity that it is
“distinctly and expressly” affirmed there&mdash;“distinctly,”
that is, not mingled with anything else&mdash;“expressly,”
that is, in words meaning just that,
without the aid of any inference, and susceptible
of no other meaning.</p>

<p>If they had only pledged their judicial opinion
that such right is affirmed in the instrument by
implication, it would be open to others to show
that neither the word “slave” nor “slavery” is
to be found in the Constitution, nor the word
“property” even, in any connection with language
alluding to the things slave, or slavery; and that
wherever in that instrument the slave is alluded
to, he is called a “person”; and wherever his
master’s legal right in relation to him is alluded
to, it is spoken of as “service or labor which may
be due”&mdash;as a debt payable in service or labor.
Also it would be open to show, by contemporaneous
history, that this mode of alluding to slaves
and slavery, instead of speaking of them, was
employed on purpose to exclude from the Constitution
the idea that there could be property in
man.</p>

<p>To show all this is easy and certain.</p>

<p>When this obvious mistake of the judges shall
be brought to their notice, is it not reasonable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
expect that they will withdraw the mistaken statement,
and reconsider the conclusion based upon it?</p>

<p>And then it is to be remembered that “our fathers
who framed the government under which
we live”&mdash;the men who made the Constitution&mdash;decided
this same constitutional question in our
favor long ago: decided it without division among
themselves when making the decision; without division
among themselves about the meaning of it
after it was made, and, so far as any evidence is
left, without basing it upon any mistaken statement
of facts.</p>

<p>Under all these circumstances, do you really feel
yourselves justified to break up this government
unless such a court decision as yours is shall be
at once submitted to as a conclusive and final rule
of political action? But you will not abide the
election of a Republican president! In that supposed
event, you say, you will destroy the Union;
and then, you say, the great crime of having destroyed
it will be upon us! That is cool. A highwayman
holds a pistol to my ear, and mutters
through his teeth, “Stand and deliver, or I shall
kill you, and then you will be a murderer!”</p>

<p>To be sure, what the robber demanded of me&mdash;my
money&mdash;was my own; and I had a clear right
to keep it; but it was no more my own than my
vote is my own; and the threat of death to me,
to extort my money, and the threat of destruction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
to the Union, to extort my vote, can scarcely be distinguished
in principle.</p>

<p>A few words now to Republicans. It is exceedingly
desirable that all parts of this great Confederacy
shall be at peace and in harmony one
with another. Let us Republicans do our part to
have it so. Even though much provoked, let us
do nothing through passion and ill-temper. Even
though the Southern people will not so much as
listen to us, let us calmly consider their demands,
and yield to them if, in our deliberate view of our
duty, we possibly can. Judging by all they say and
do, and by the subject and nature of their controversy
with us, let us determine, if we can, what
will satisfy them.</p>

<p>Will they be satisfied if the Territories be unconditionally
surrendered to them? We know
they will not. In all their present complaints
against us, the Territories are scarcely mentioned.
Invasions and insurrections are the rage now.
Will it satisfy them if, in the future, we have nothing
to do with invasions and insurrections? We
know it will not. We so know, because we know
we never had anything to do with invasions and
insurrections; and yet this total abstaining does
not exempt us from the charge and the denunciation.</p>

<p>The question recurs, What will satisfy them?
Simply this: we must not only let them alone, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
we must somehow convince them that we do let
them alone. This, we know by experience, is no
easy task. We have been so trying to convince
them from the very beginning of our organization,
but with no success. In all our platforms and
speeches we have constantly protested our purpose
to let them alone; but this has had no tendency to
convince them. Alike unavailing to convince them
is the fact that they have never detected a man of
us in any attempt to disturb them.</p>

<p>These natural and apparently adequate means
all failing, what will convince them? This, and
this only: cease to call slavery wrong, and join
them in calling it right. And this must be done
thoroughly&mdash;done in acts as well as in words. Silence
will not be tolerated&mdash;we must place ourselves
avowedly with them. Senator Douglas’s
new sedition law must be enacted and enforced,
suppressing all declarations that slavery is wrong,
whether made in politics, in presses, in pulpits, or
in private. We must arrest and return their fugitive
slaves with greedy pleasure. We must pull
down our free-State constitutions. The whole atmosphere
must be disinfected from all taint of
opposition to slavery, before they will cease to
believe that all their troubles proceed from us.</p>

<p>I am quite aware they do not state their case
precisely in this way. Most of them would probably
say to us, “Let us alone; do nothing to us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
and say what you please about slavery.” But we
do let them alone,&mdash;have never disturbed them,&mdash;so
that, after all, it is what we say which dissatisfies
them. They will continue to accuse us of doing,
until we cease saying.</p>

<p>I am also aware they have not as yet in terms
demanded the overthrow of our free-State constitutions.
Yet those constitutions declare the wrong
of slavery with more solemn emphasis than do all
other sayings against it; and when all these other
sayings shall have been silenced, the overthrow of
these constitutions will be demanded, and nothing
be left to resist the demand. It is nothing to the
contrary that they do not demand the whole of this
just now. Demanding what they do, and for the
reason they do, they can voluntarily stop nowhere
short of this consummation. Holding, as they do,
that slavery is morally right and socially elevating,
they cannot cease to demand a full national recognition
of it as a legal right and a social blessing.</p>

<p>Nor can we justifiably withhold this on any
ground save our conviction that slavery is wrong.
If slavery is right, all words, acts, laws, and constitutions
against it are themselves wrong, and should
be silenced and swept away. If it is right, we cannot
justly object to its nationality&mdash;its universality;
if it is wrong, they cannot justly insist upon its
extension&mdash;its enlargement. All they ask we could
readily grant, if we thought slavery right; all we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
ask they could as readily grant, if they thought it
wrong. Their thinking it right and our thinking
it wrong is the precise fact upon which depends
the whole controversy. Thinking it right, as they
do, they are not to blame for desiring its full recognition
as being right; but thinking it wrong, as
we do, can we yield to them? Can we cast our
votes with their view, and against our own? In
view of our moral, social, and political responsibilities,
can we do this?</p>

<p>Wrong as we think slavery is, we can yet afford
to let it alone where it is, because that much is due
to the necessity arising from its actual presence in
the nation; but can we, while our votes will prevent
it, allow it to spread into the national Territories,
and to overrun us here in these free States?
If our sense of duty forbids this, then let us stand
by our duty fearlessly and effectively. Let us be
diverted by none of those sophistical contrivances
wherewith we are so industriously plied and belabored&mdash;contrivances
such as groping for some
middle ground between the right and the wrong:
vain as the search for a man who should be neither
a living man nor a dead man; such as a policy of
“don’t care” on a question about which all true
men do care; such as Union appeals beseeching
true Union men to yield to Disunionists, reversing
the divine rule, and calling, not the sinners, but
the righteous, to repentance; such as invocations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
to Washington, imploring men to unsay what
Washington said and undo what Washington did.</p>

<p>Neither let us be slandered from our duty by
false accusations against us, nor frightened from
it by menaces of destruction to the government,
nor of dungeons to ourselves. Let us have faith
that right makes might, and in that faith let us
to the end dare to do our duty as we understand it.</p>

<h2><a name="LINCOLNS_FIRST_INAUGURAL_ADDRESS" id="LINCOLNS_FIRST_INAUGURAL_ADDRESS"></a>LINCOLN’S FIRST INAUGURAL ADDRESS</h2>

<p class="p2 b2 center">MARCH 4, 1861</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fellow-Citizens of the United States</span>:&mdash;In
compliance with a custom as old as the government
itself, I appear before you to address you
briefly, and to take, in your presence, the oath prescribed
by the Constitution of the United States
to be taken by the President before he enters on
the execution of his office.</p>

<p>I do not consider it necessary, at present, for
me to discuss those matters of administration about
which there is no special anxiety or excitement.
Apprehension seems to exist among the people of
the Southern States, that, by the accession of a Republican
administration, their property and their
peace and personal security are to be endangered.
There has never been any reasonable cause for such
apprehension. Indeed, the most ample evidence
to the contrary has all the while existed and been
open to their inspection. It is found in nearly all
the published speeches of him who now addresses
you. I do but quote from one of those speeches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
when I declare that “I have no purpose, directly
or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of
slavery in the States where it exists.” I believe I
have no lawful right to do so; and I have no inclination
to do so. Those who nominated and elected
me did so with the full knowledge that I had made
this, and made many similar declarations, and had
never recanted them. And, more than this, they
placed in the platform, for my acceptance, and
as a law to themselves and to me, the clear and
emphatic resolution which I now read:</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the maintenance inviolate of
the rights of the States, and especially the right of
each State to order and control its own domestic
institutions according to its own judgment exclusively,
is essential to that balance of power on
which the perfection and endurance of our political
fabric depend; and we denounce the lawless invasion
by armed force of the soil of any State or
Territory, no matter under what pretext, as among
the gravest of crimes.”</p>

<p>I now reiterate these sentiments; and in doing
so I only press upon the public attention the most
conclusive evidence of which the case is susceptible,
that the property, peace, and security of no section
are to be in anywise endangered by the now
incoming administration.</p>

<p>I add, too, that all the protection which, consistently
with the Constitution and the law, can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
given, will be cheerfully given to all the States
when lawfully demanded, for whatever cause, as
cheerfully to one section as to another.</p>

<p>There is much controversy about the delivering
up of fugitives from service or labor. The clause
I now read is as plainly written in the Constitution
as any other of its provisions:</p>

<p>“No person held to service or labor in one
State under the laws thereof, escaping into another,
shall, in consequence of any law or regulation
therein, be discharged from such service or labor,
but shall be delivered up on claim of the party
to whom such service or labor may be due.”</p>

<p>It is scarcely questioned that this provision was
intended by those who made it for the reclaiming
of what we call fugitive slaves; and the intention
of the law-giver is the law.</p>

<p>All members of Congress swear their support
to the whole Constitution&mdash;to this provision as
well as any other. To the proposition, then, that
slaves whose cases come within the terms of this
clause “shall be delivered up,” their oaths are
unanimous. Now, if they would make the effort
in good temper, could they not, with nearly equal
unanimity, frame and pass a law by means of
which to keep good that unanimous oath?</p>

<p>There is some difference of opinion whether this
clause should be enforced by national or by State
authority; but surely that difference is not a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
material one. If the slave is to be surrendered, it
can be of but little consequence to him or to others
by which authority it is done; and should anyone,
in any case, be content that this oath shall go unkept
on a merely unsubstantial controversy as to
how it shall be kept?</p>

<p>Again, in any law upon this subject, ought not
all the safeguards of liberty known in civilized
and humane jurisprudence to be introduced, so that
a free man be not, in any case, surrendered as a
slave? And might it not be well at the same time
to provide by law for the enforcement of that
clause in the Constitution which guarantees that
“the citizens of each State shall be entitled to all
the privileges and immunities of citizens in the
several States?”</p>

<p>I take the official oath to-day with no mental
reservations, and with no purpose to construe the
Constitution or laws by any hypercritical rules; and
while I do not choose now to specify particular
acts of Congress as proper to be enforced, I do
suggest that it will be much safer for all, both in
official and private stations, to conform to and
abide by all those acts which stand unrepealed,
than to violate any of them, trusting to find impunity
in having them held to be unconstitutional.</p>

<p>It is seventy-two years since the first inauguration
of a President under our National Constitution.
During that period, fifteen different and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
very distinguished citizens have in succession administered
the executive branch of the Government.
They have conducted it through many
perils, and generally with great success. Yet, with
all this scope for precedent, I now enter upon the
same task, for the brief constitutional term of
four years, under great and peculiar difficulties.</p>

<p>A disruption of the Federal Union, heretofore
only menaced, is now formidably attempted. I
hold that in the contemplation of universal law
and of the Constitution, the union of these States
is perpetual. Perpetuity is implied, if not expressed,
in the fundamental law of all national
governments. It is safe to assert that no government
proper ever had a provision in its organic
law for its own termination. Continue to execute
all the express provisions of our National Constitution,
and the Union will endure forever, it
being impossible to destroy it, except by some action
not provided for in the instrument itself.</p>

<p>Again, if the United States be not a government
proper, but an association of States in the
nature of a contract merely, can it, as a contract,
be peaceably unmade by less than all the parties
who made it? One party to a contract may violate
it&mdash;break it, so to speak; but does it not
require all to lawfully rescind it? Descending
from these general principles, we find the proposition
that in legal contemplation the Union is perpetual,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
confirmed by the history of the Union
itself.</p>

<p>The Union is much older than the Constitution.
It was formed, in fact, by the Articles of Association
in 1774. It was matured and continued in
the Declaration of Independence in 1776. It was
further matured, and the faith of all the then thirteen
States expressly plighted and engaged that it
should be perpetual, by the Articles of the Confederation,
in 1778; and finally, in 1787, one of
the declared objects for ordaining and establishing
the Constitution was to form a more perfect
Union. But if the destruction of the Union by one
or by a part only of the States be lawfully possible,
the Union is less perfect than before, the Constitution
having lost the vital element of perpetuity.</p>

<p>It follows from these views that no State, upon
its own mere motion, can lawfully get out of the
Union; that resolves and ordinances to that effect
are legally void; and that acts of violence within
any State or States against the authority of the
United States are insurrectionary or revolutionary,
according to circumstances.</p>

<p>I therefore consider that, in view of the Constitution
and the laws, the Union is unbroken, and,
to the extent of my ability, I shall take care, as the
Constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me, that
the laws of the Union shall be faithfully executed
in all the States. Doing this, which I deem to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
only a simple duty on my part, I shall perfectly
perform it, so far as is practicable, unless my rightful
masters, the American people, shall withhold
the requisition, or in some authoritative manner
direct the contrary.</p>

<p>I trust this will not be regarded as a menace,
but only as the declared purpose of the Union that
it will constitutionally defend and maintain itself.</p>

<p>In doing this there need be no bloodshed or
violence, and there shall be none unless it is forced
upon the national authority.</p>

<p>The power confided to me <i>will be used to hold,
occupy, and possess the property and places belonging
to the Government</i>, and collect the duties
and imposts; but beyond what may be necessary
for these objects there will be no invasion, no using
of force against or among the people anywhere.</p>

<p>Where hostility to the United States shall be
so great and so universal as to prevent competent
resident citizens from holding Federal offices, there
will be no attempt to force obnoxious strangers
among the people that object. While strict legal
right may exist of the Government to enforce the
exercise of these offices, the attempt to do so would
be so irritating, and so nearly impracticable withal,
that I deem it best to forego, for the time, the
uses of such offices.</p>

<p>The mails, unless repelled, will continue to be
furnished in all parts of the Union.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
So far as possible, the people everywhere shall
have that sense of perfect security which is most
favorable to calm thought and reflection.</p>

<p>The course here indicated will be followed, unless
current events and experience shall show a
modification or change to be proper; and in every
case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised
according to the circumstances actually existing,
and with a view and hope of a peaceful solution
of the national troubles, and the restoration
of fraternal sympathies and affections.</p>

<p>That there are persons, in one section or another,
who seek to destroy the Union at all events,
and are glad of any pretext to do it, I will neither
affirm nor deny. But if there be such, I need address
no word to them.</p>

<p>To those, however, who really love the Union,
may I not speak, before entering upon so grave
a matter as the destruction of our national fabric,
with all its benefits, its memories, and its hopes?
Would it not be well to ascertain why we do it?
Will you hazard so desperate a step, while any
portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence?
Will you, while the certain ills you fly
to are greater than all the real ones you fly from?
Will you risk the commission of so fearful a mistake?
All profess to be content in the Union if
all constitutional rights can be maintained. Is it
true, then, that any right, plainly written in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
Constitution, has been denied? I think not. Happily
the human mind is so constituted that no party
can reach to the audacity of doing this.</p>

<p>Think, if you can, of a single instance in which
a plainly-written provision of the Constitution has
ever been denied. If, by the mere force of numbers,
a majority should deprive a minority of any
clearly-written constitutional right, it might, in a
moral point of view, justify revolution; it certainly
would if such right were a vital one. But such is
not our case.</p>

<p>All the vital rights of minorities and of individuals
are so plainly assured to them by affirmations
and negations, guarantees and prohibitions in the
Constitution, that controversies never arise concerning
them. But no organic law can ever be
framed with a provision specifically applicable to
every question which may occur in practicable administration.
No foresight can anticipate, nor
any document of reasonable length contain, express
provisions for all possible questions. Shall
fugitives from labor be surrendered by National
or by State authorities? The Constitution does
not expressly say. Must Congress protect slavery
in the Territories? The Constitution does not expressly
say. From questions of this class spring
all our constitutional controversies, and we divide
upon them into majorities and minorities.</p>

<p>If the minority will not acquiesce, the majority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
must, or the Government must cease. There is no
alternative for continuing the Government but acquiescence
on the one side or the other. If a
minority in such a case will secede rather than
acquiesce, they make a precedent which, in turn,
will ruin and divide them, for a minority of their
own will secede from them whenever a majority
refuses to be controlled by such a minority. For
instance, why may not any portion of a new Confederacy,
a year or two hence, arbitrarily secede
again, precisely as portions of the present Union
now claim to secede from it? All who cherish disunion
sentiments are now being educated to the
exact temper of doing this. Is there such perfect
identity of interests among the States to compose
a new Union as to produce harmony only, and
prevent renewed secession? Plainly, the central
idea of secession is the essence of anarchy.</p>

<p>A majority held in restraint by constitutional
check and limitation, and always changing easily
with deliberate changes of popular opinions and
sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free
people. Whoever rejects it, does, of necessity,
fly to anarchy or to despotism. Unanimity is impossible;
the rule of a minority, as a permanent arrangement,
is wholly inadmissible. So that, rejecting
the majority principle, anarchy or despotism,
in some form, is all that is left.</p>

<p>I do not forget the position assumed by some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
that constitutional questions are to be decided by
the Supreme Court, nor do I deny that such decisions
must be binding in any case upon the parties
to a suit, as to the object of that suit, while they
are also entitled to a very high respect and consideration
in all parallel cases by all other departments
of the Government; and while it is obviously
possible that such decision may be erroneous
in any given case, still the evil effect following it,
being limited to that particular case, with the
chance that it may be overruled and never become
a precedent for other cases, can better be borne
than could the evils of a different practice.</p>

<p>At the same time the candid citizen must confess
that if the policy of the Government upon
the vital question affecting the whole people is to
be irrevocably fixed by the decisions of the Supreme
Court, the instant they are made, as in ordinary
litigation between parties in personal actions,
the people will have ceased to be their own masters,
unless having to that extent practically resigned
their Government into the hands of that
eminent tribunal.</p>

<p>Nor is there in this view any assault upon the
Court or the Judges. It is a duty from which
they may not shrink, to decide cases properly
brought before them; and it is no fault of theirs
if others seek to turn their decisions to political purposes.
One section of our country believes slavery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
is right and ought to be extended, while the other
believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended;
and this is the only substantial dispute; and the
fugitive slave clause of the Constitution, and the
law for the suppression of the foreign slave-trade,
are each as well enforced, perhaps, as any law can
ever be in a community where the moral sense of
the people imperfectly supports the law itself. The
great body of the people abide by the dry legal
obligation in both cases, and a few break over in
each. This, I think, cannot be perfectly cured,
and it would be worse in both cases after the separation
of the sections than before. The foreign
slave-trade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be
ultimately revived, without restriction, in one section;
while fugitive slaves, now only partially surrendered,
would not be surrendered at all by the
other.</p>

<p>Physically speaking, we cannot separate; we
cannot remove our respective sections from each
other, nor build an impassable wall between them.
A husband and wife may be divorced, and go out
of the presence and beyond the reach of each other,
but the different parts of our country cannot do
this. They cannot but remain face to face; and
intercourse, either amicable or hostile, must continue
between them. Is it possible, then, to make
that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory
after separation than before? Can aliens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
make treaties easier than friends can make laws?
Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between
aliens than laws can among friends? Suppose you
go to war, you cannot fight always; and when, after
much loss on both sides and no gain on either, you
cease fighting, the identical questions as to terms
of intercourse are again upon you.</p>

<p>This country, with its institutions, belongs to the
people who inhabit it. Whenever they shall grow
weary of the existing government, they can exercise
their constitutional right of amending, or their
revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it.
I cannot be ignorant of the fact that many worthy
and patriotic citizens are desirous of having the
National Constitution amended. While I make no
recommendation of amendment, I fully recognize
the full authority of the people over the whole
subject, to be exercised in either of the modes prescribed
in the instrument itself, and I should, under
existing circumstances, favor, rather than oppose,
a fair opportunity being afforded the people
to act upon it.</p>

<p>I will venture to add that to me the convention
mode seems preferable, in that it allows amendments
to originate with the people themselves, instead
of only permitting them to take or reject
propositions originated by others not especially
chosen for the purpose, and which might not be
precisely such as they would wish either to accept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
or refuse. I understand that a proposed amendment
to the Constitution (which amendment, however,
I have not seen) has passed Congress, to the
effect that the Federal Government shall never interfere
with the domestic institutions of States, including
that of persons held to service. To avoid
misconstruction of what I have said, I depart from
my purpose not to speak of particular amendments,
so far as to say that, holding such a provision to
now be implied constitutional law, I have no objection
to its being made express and irrevocable.</p>

<p>The Chief Magistrate derives all his authority
from the people, and they have conferred none
upon him to fix the terms for the separation of the
States. The people themselves, also, can do this
if they choose, but the Executive, as such, has nothing
to do with it. His duty is to administer the
present government as it came to his hands, and
to transmit it unimpaired by him to his successor.
Why should there not be a patient confidence in
the ultimate justice of the people? Is there any
better or equal hope in the world? In our present
differences is either party without faith of being
in the right? If the Almighty Ruler of nations,
with his eternal truth and justice, be on your side
of the North, or on yours of the South, that truth
and that justice will surely prevail by the judgment
of this great tribunal, the American people. By
the frame of the Government under which we live,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
this same people have wisely given their public
servants but little power for mischief, and have
with equal wisdom provided for the return of that
little to their own hands at very short intervals.
While the people retain their virtue and vigilance,
no administration, by any extreme wickedness or
folly, can very seriously injure the Government in
the short space of four years.</p>

<p>My countrymen, one and all, think calmly and
well upon this whole subject. Nothing valuable
can be lost by taking time.</p>

<p>If there be an object to hurry any of you, in
hot haste, to a step which you would never take
deliberately, that object will be frustrated by taking
time; but no good object can be frustrated
by it.</p>

<p>Such of you as are now dissatisfied still have the
old Constitution unimpaired, and on the sensitive
point, the laws of your own framing under it;
while the new administration will have no immediate
power, if it would, to change either.</p>

<p>If it were admitted that you who are dissatisfied
hold the right side in the dispute, there is still
no single reason for precipitate action. Intelligence,
patriotism, Christianity, and a firm reliance
on Him who has never yet forsaken this favored
land, are still competent to adjust, in the best way,
all our present difficulties.</p>

<p>In your hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
and not in mine, is the momentous issue of
civil war. The Government will not assail you.</p>

<p>You can have no conflict without being yourselves
the aggressors. You have no oath registered
in heaven to destroy the Government, while I
shall have the most solemn one to “preserve, protect,
and defend” it.</p>

<p>I am loath to close. We are not enemies, but
friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion
may have strained, it must not break, our
bonds of affections.</p>

<p>The mystic cords of memory, stretching from
every battlefield and patriot grave to every living
heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will
yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again
touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels
of our nature.</p>

<h2><a name="LINCOLNS_GETTYSBURG_SPEECH" id="LINCOLNS_GETTYSBURG_SPEECH"></a>LINCOLN’S GETTYSBURG SPEECH</h2>

<p class="p2 b2 center">AT THE DEDICATION OF THE NATIONAL CEMETERY
AT GETTYSBURG, PA., NOVEMBER 15,
1863</p>

<p>Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers
brought forth upon this continent a new nation,
conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition
that all men are created equal. Now we are
engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that
nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated,
can long endure. We are met on a great
battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate
a portion of that field as a final resting-place for
those who here gave their lives that that nation
might live. It is altogether fitting and proper
that we should do this. But in a larger sense we
cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot
hallow this ground. The brave men, living and
dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it far
above our power to add or detract. The world
will little note, nor long remember, what we say
here; but it can never forget what they did here.
It is for us, the living, rather to be dedicated here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
to the unfinished work which they who fought here
have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather
for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining
before us, that from these honored dead
we take increased devotion to that cause for which
they gave the last full measure of devotion; that
we here highly resolve that these dead shall not
have died in vain; that this nation, under God,
shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government
of the people, by the people, and for the
people, shall not perish from the earth.</p>

<h2><a name="LINCOLNS_SECOND_INAUGURAL_ADDRESS" id="LINCOLNS_SECOND_INAUGURAL_ADDRESS"></a>LINCOLN’S SECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS</h2>

<p class="p2 b2 center">MARCH 4, 1865</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fellow-Countrymen</span>:&mdash;At this second appearing
to take the oath of the Presidential office,
there is less occasion for an extended address
than there was at the first. Then a statement somewhat
in detail of a course to be pursued seemed
very fitting and proper. Now, at the expiration of
four years, during which public declarations have
been constantly called forth on every point and
phase of the great contest which still absorbs the
attention and engrosses the energies of the nation,
little that is new could be presented.</p>

<p>The progress of our arms, upon which all else
chiefly depends, is as well known to the public as
to myself; and it is, I trust, reasonably satisfactory
and encouraging to all. With high hope for the
future, no prediction in regard to it is ventured.</p>

<p>On the occasion corresponding to this, four years
ago, all thoughts were anxiously directed to an
impending civil war. All dreaded it; all sought to
avoid it. While the inaugural address was being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
delivered from this place, devoted altogether to
saving the Union without war, insurgent agents
were in the city seeking to destroy it without war&mdash;seeking
to dissolve the Union and divide the
effects by negotiation. Both parties deprecated
war; but one of them would make war rather than
let the nation survive, and the other would accept
war rather than let it perish; and the war came.</p>

<p>One-eighth of the whole population were colored
slaves, not distributed generally over the
Union, but localized in the southern part of it.
These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful
interest. All knew that this interest was somehow
the cause of the war. To strengthen, perpetuate,
and extend this interest, was the object for which
the insurgents would rend the Union even by war,
while the Government claimed no right to do more
than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it.</p>

<p>Neither party expected for the war the magnitude
or the duration which it has already attained.
Neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict
might cease with, or even before, the conflict itself
should cease. Each looked for an easier
triumph, and a result less fundamental and
astounding.</p>

<p>Both read the same Bible and pray to the same
God, and each invokes his aid against the other.
It may seem strange that any men should dare to
ask a just God’s assistance in wringing their bread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
from the sweat of other men’s faces; but let us
judge not, that we be not judged. The prayers
of both could not be answered. That of neither
has been answered fully. The Almighty has his
own purposes. “Woe unto the world because of
offenses, for it must needs be that offenses come;
but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh.”
If we shall suppose that American slavery is one
of these offenses, which in the providence of God
must needs come, but which, having continued
through his appointed time, he now wills to remove,
and that he gives to both North and South
this terrible war as the woe due to those by whom
the offense came, shall we discern therein any departure
from those divine attributes which the believers
in a living God always ascribe to him?
Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this
mighty scourge of war may soon pass away. Yet,
if God wills that it continue until all the wealth
piled by the bondman’s two hundred and fifty
years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until
every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be
paid with another drawn with the sword; as was
said three thousand years ago, so still it must be
said, “The judgments of the Lord are true and
righteous altogether.”</p>

<p>With malice toward none, with charity for all,
with firmness in the right as God gives us to see
the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
in, to bind up the nation’s wounds, to care for
him who shall have borne the battle and for his
widow and orphans, to do all which may achieve
and cherish a just and a lasting peace among ourselves
and with all nations.</p>

<h2><a name="PROCLAMATION_OF_EMANCIPATION" id="PROCLAMATION_OF_EMANCIPATION"></a>PROCLAMATION OF EMANCIPATION</h2>

<p class="p2 b2 center">JANUARY 1, 1863</p>

<p>Whereas, on the twenty-second day of September,
in the year of our Lord one thousand eight
hundred and sixty-two, a proclamation was issued
by the President of the United States, containing,
among other things, the following, to wit:</p>

<p>“That on the first day of January, in the year
of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three,
all persons held as slaves within any State
or designated part of a State, the people whereof
shall then be in rebellion against the United States,
shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free;
and the Executive Government of the United
States, including the military and naval authority
thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom
of such persons, and will do no act or acts to repress
such persons or any of them, in any efforts
they may make for their actual freedom.</p>

<p>“That the Executive will, on the first day of
January aforesaid, by proclamation, designate the
States and parts of States, if any, in which the people
thereof respectively shall then be in rebellion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
against the United States; and the fact that any
State, or the people thereof, shall on that day be
in good faith represented in the Congress of the
United States, by members chosen thereto at elections
wherein a majority of the qualified voters of
such State shall have participated, shall, in the
absence of strong countervailing testimony, be
deemed conclusive evidence that such State, and
the people thereof, are not then in rebellion against
the United States.”</p>

<p>Now, therefore, I, <span class="smcap">Abraham Lincoln</span>, President
of the United States, by virtue of the power
in me vested as Commander-in-Chief of the army
and navy of the United States in time of actual
armed rebellion against the authority and government
of the United States, and as a fit and necessary
war measure for suppressing said rebellion,
do, on this first day of January, in the year of our
Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three,
and in accordance with my purpose so to do, publicly
proclaimed for the full period of one hundred
days from the day first above mentioned, order and
designate, as the States and parts of States wherein
the people thereof respectively are this day in rebellion
against the United States, the following,
to wit:</p>

<p>Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana (except the parishes
of St. Bernard, Plaquemines, Jefferson, St. John,
St. Charles, St. James, Ascension, Assumption,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
Terre Bonne, Lafourche, St. Marie, St. Martin,
and Orleans, including the city of New Orleans),
Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South
Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia (except
the forty-eight counties designated as West Virginia,
and also the counties of Berkeley, Accomac,
Northampton, Elizabeth City, York, Princess
Anne, and Norfolk, including the cities of Norfolk
and Portsmouth), and which excepted parts are
for the present left precisely as if this proclamation
were not issued.</p>

<p>And, by virtue of the power and for the purpose
aforesaid, I do order and declare that all
persons held as slaves within said designated States
and parts of States are and henceforth shall be
free; and that the Executive Government of the
United States, including the military and naval
authorities thereof, will recognize and maintain the
freedom of said persons.</p>

<p>And I hereby enjoin upon the people so declared
to be free, to abstain from all violence, unless in
necessary self-defense; and I recommend to them
that in all cases, when allowed, they labor faithfully
for reasonable wages.</p>

<p>And I further declare and make known that
such persons of suitable condition will be received
into the armed service of the United States, to
garrison forts, positions, stations, and other places,
and to man vessels of all sorts in said service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
And upon this act, sincerely believed to be an
act of justice, warranted by the Constitution, upon
military necessity, I invoke the considerate judgment
of mankind and the gracious favor of Almighty
God.</p>

<h2><a name="STEPHEN_ARNOLD_DOUGLAS" id="STEPHEN_ARNOLD_DOUGLAS"></a>STEPHEN ARNOLD DOUGLAS<br />

<span class="subhead">BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Stephen Arnold Douglas</span> was born at Brandon,
Vermont, on the 23d of April, 1813.</p>

<p>When a child he lived on a farm, working in
the fields in the summer and attending the district
school during the winter months. At the age of
fifteen young Douglas realized his condition in life,&mdash;that
his widowed mother was not in circumstances
to give him an education, so he suppressed
his ambition for college for the time, and apprenticed
himself to a cabinet-maker in Middlebury.
Here he worked with enthusiasm for two years.
The following year he spent in Brandon, his native
town, attending the academy. At the close
of that year he moved with his mother to Canandaigua,
N. Y., at once becoming a student at the
fine academy located there. He remained in
Canandaigua three years, applying himself diligently
to his academic studies, also finding time
to follow a course in the study of law.</p>

<p>In 1833 the young man of twenty-three years
removed to Winchester, Ill., to earn for himself a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
livelihood. For a few months he taught school
and continued his law studies. The next year he
was admitted to the bar in Jacksonville, where he
had stopped for a short time, before reaching
Winchester.</p>

<p>Mr. Douglas was elected State’s Attorney of
the First Judicial District in 1835. In 1836 he
was elected to the Illinois legislature. The following
year he was appointed Register of Public
Lands at Springfield, to which place he removed.
In 1841 he was appointed Secretary of State; but
soon resigned, to accept the office of Judge of the
Supreme Court of the State. In 1843 Mr. Douglas
was elected to Congress, where he served for two
terms; he was re-elected to the House for the
third term, but at the following session of the
legislature, December, 1846, he was chosen for
the United States Senate, of which he remained
a member until his death.</p>

<p>Senator Douglas died on the 3d of June, 1861.</p>

<h2><a name="LINCOLN-DOUGLAS_DEBATE" id="LINCOLN-DOUGLAS_DEBATE"></a>LINCOLN-DOUGLAS DEBATE<br />

<span class="subhead">FIRST JOINT DEBATE, DELIVERED AT OTTAWA,
ILL., AUGUST 21, 1858</span></h2>

<h3><i>Douglas’s Opening Speech</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Ladies and Gentlemen</span>:&mdash;I appear before
you to-day for the purpose of discussing the leading
political topics which now agitate the public
mind. By an arrangement between Mr. Lincoln
and myself, we are present here to-day for the
purpose of having a joint discussion, as the representatives
of the two great political parties of the
State and Union, upon the principles in issue between
those parties; and this vast concourse of
people shows the deep feeling which pervades
the public mind in regard to the questions dividing
us.</p>

<p>Prior to 1854, this country was divided into two
great political parties, known as the Whig and
Democratic parties. Both were national and patriotic,
advocating principles that were universal
in their application. An old-line Whig could proclaim
his principles in Louisiana and Massachusetts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
alike. Whig principles had no boundary sectional
line; they were not limited by the Ohio river,
nor by the Potomac, nor by the line of the free and
slave States, but applied and were proclaimed
wherever the Constitution ruled or the American
flag waved over the American soil. So it was and
so it is with the great Democratic party, which
from the days of Jefferson until this period has
proven itself to be the historic party of this nation.
While the Whig and Democratic parties differed in
regard to a bank, the tariff, distribution, the specie
circular, and the sub-treasury, they agreed on the
great slavery question which now agitates the
Union. I say that the Whig party and the Democratic
party agreed on the slavery question, while
they differed on those matters of expediency to
which I have referred. The Whig party and the
Democratic party jointly adopted the compromise
measures of 1850 as the basis of a proper and just
solution of the slavery question in all its forms.
Clay was the great leader, with Webster on his
right and Cass on his left and sustained by the patriots
in the Whig and Democratic ranks, who had
devised and enacted the compromise measures of
1850.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>During the session of Congress of 1853&ndash;54, I
introduced into the Senate of the United States a
bill to organize the Territories of Kansas and Nebraska<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
on that principle which had been adopted
in the compromise measures of 1850, approved by
the Whig party and the Democratic party in Illinois
in 1851, and indorsed by the Whig party and
the Democratic party in national convention in
1852. In order that there might be no misunderstanding
in relation to the principle involved in
the Kansas and Nebraska bill, I put forth the true
intent and meaning of the act in these words: “It
is the true intent and meaning of this act not to
legislate slavery into any State or Territory, or to
exclude it therefrom, but to leave the people
thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their
domestic institutions in their own way, subject only
to the Federal Constitution.” Thus you see that
up to 1854, when the Kansas and Nebraska bill
was brought into Congress for the purpose of carrying
out the principles which both parties had up
to that time indorsed and approved, there had
been no division in this country in regard to
that principle, except the opposition of the Abolitionists....</p>

<p>In 1854 Mr. Abraham Lincoln and Mr. Lyman
Trumbull entered into an arrangement, one with
the other, and each with his respective friends, to
dissolve the old Whig party on the one hand, and
to dissolve the old Democratic party on the other,
and to connect the members of both into an Abolition
party, under the name and disguise of a Republican<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
party. The terms of that arrangement between
Lincoln and Trumbull have been published
by Lincoln’s special friend, James H. Matheny,
Esq.; and they were that Lincoln should have
General Shields’ place in the United States Senate,
which was then about to become vacant, and that
Trumbull should have my seat when my term expired.
Lincoln went to work to Abolitionize the
old Whig party all over the State, pretending that
he was then as good a Whig as ever; and Trumbull
went to work in his part of the State preaching
Abolitionism in its milder and lighter form, and
trying to Abolitionize the Democratic party and
bring old Democrats handcuffed and bound hand
and foot into the Abolition camp. In pursuance
of the arrangement, the parties met at Springfield
in October, 1854, and proclaimed their new platform.
Lincoln was to bring into the Abolition
camp the old-line Whigs and transfer them over
to Giddings, Chase, Fred Douglass, and Parson
Lovejoy, who were ready to receive them and
christen them in their new faith. They laid down
on that occasion a platform for their new Republican
party, which was thus to be constructed. I
have the resolutions of the State convention then
held, which was the first mass State convention ever
held in Illinois by the Black Republican party; and
I now hold them in my hands and will read a part
of them, and cause the others to be printed. Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
are the most important and material resolutions of
this Abolition <span class="locked">platform:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, “That we believe this truth to be self-evident,
that when parties become subversive of the
ends for which they are established, or incapable
of restoring the government to the true principles
of the Constitution, it is the right and duty of the
people to dissolve the political bands by which
they may have been connected therewith, and to
organize new parties upon such principles and with
such views as the circumstances and exigencies of
the nation may demand.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, “That the times imperatively demand
the reorganization of parties, and, repudiating all
previous party attachments, names, and predilections,
we unite ourselves together in defense of the
liberty and Constitution of the country, and will
hereafter co-operate as the Republican party,
pledged to the accomplishment of the following
purposes: to bring the administration of the government
back to the control of first principles; to
restore Nebraska and Kansas to the position of
free Territories; that, as the Constitution of the
United States vests in the States and not in Congress
the power to legislate for the extradition of
fugitives from labor, to repeal and entirely abrogate
the fugitive-slave law; to restrict slavery to
those States in which it exists; to prohibit the admission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
of any more slave States into the Union;
to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia; to
exclude slavery from all the Territories over which
the general government has exclusive jurisdiction;
and to resist the acquirement of any more Territories
unless the practice of slavery therein forever
shall have been prohibited.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, “That in furtherance of these principles
we will use such constitutional and lawful
means as shall seem best adapted to their accomplishment,
and that we will support no man for
office, under the general or State government, who
is not positively and fully committed to the support
of these principles, and whose personal character
and conduct is not a guarantee that he is reliable,
and who shall not have abjured old party allegiance
and ties.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, gentlemen, your Black Republicans have
cheered every one of those propositions, and yet I
venture to say that you cannot get Mr. Lincoln to
come out and say that he is now in favor of each
one of them. That these propositions, one and all,
constitute the platform of the Black Republican
party of this day, I have no doubt; and when you
were not aware for what purpose I was reading
them, your Black Republicans cheered them as good
Black Republican doctrines.</p>

<p>My object in reading these resolutions was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
put the question to Abraham Lincoln this day,
whether he now stands and will stand by each
article in that creed, and carry it out. [1] I desire
to know whether Mr. Lincoln to-day stands
as he did in 1854, in favor of the unconditional
repeal of the fugitive-slave law. [2] I desire him
to answer whether he stands pledged to-day, as
he did in 1854, against the admission of any more
slave States into the Union, even if the people
want them. [3] I want to know whether he stands
pledged against the admission of a new State into
the Union with such a constitution as the people
of that State may see fit to make. [4] I want to
know whether he stands to-day pledged to the
abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia.
[5] I desire him to answer whether he stands
pledged to the prohibition of the slave-trade between
the different States. [6] I desire to know
whether he stands pledged to prohibit slavery in
all the Territories of the United States, north as
well as south of the Missouri Compromise line.
[7] I desire him to answer whether he is opposed
to the acquisition of any more territory unless
slavery is prohibited therein. I want his answer
to these questions. Your affirmative cheers in
favor of this Abolition platform are not satisfactory.
I ask Abraham Lincoln to answer these
questions, in order that, when I trot him down to
lower Egypt [Southernmost Illinois] I may put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
the same questions to him. My principles are the
same everywhere. I can proclaim them alike in
the North, the South, the East, and the West.
My principles will apply wherever the Constitution
prevails and the American flag waves. I desire
to know whether Mr. Lincoln’s principles will
bear transplanting from Ottawa to Jonesboro? I
put these questions to him to-day distinctly, and
ask an answer. I have a right to an answer; for
I quote from the platform of the Republican
party, made by himself and others at the time that
party was formed, and the bargain made by Lincoln
to dissolve and kill the old Whig party and
transfer its members, bound hand and foot, to
the Abolition party under the direction of Giddings
and Fred Douglass.</p>

<p>In the remarks I have made on this platform,
and the position of Mr. Lincoln upon it, I mean
nothing personally disrespectful or unkind to that
gentleman. I have known him for nearly twenty-five
years. There were many points of sympathy
between us when we first got acquainted. We
were both comparatively boys, and both struggling
with poverty in a strange land. I was a
school-teacher in the town of Winchester, and he
a flourishing grocery-keeper in the town of Salem.
He was more successful in his occupation than I
was in mine, and hence more fortunate in this
world’s goods. Lincoln is one of those peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
men who perform with admirable skill everything
which they undertake. I made as good a school-teacher
as I could, and, when a cabinet-maker, I
made a good bedstead and tables, although my old
boss said I succeeded better with bureaus and secretaries
than with anything else; but I believe that
Lincoln was always more successful in business
than I, for his business enabled him to get into
the legislature. I met him there, however, and
had sympathy with him, because of the up-hill
struggle we both had in life. He was then just
as good at telling an anecdote as now. He could
beat any of the boys wrestling or running a footrace,
in pitching quoits or tossing a copper; could
ruin more liquor than all the boys together; and
the dignity and impartiality with which he presided
at a horse-race or fist-fight excited the admiration
and won the praise of everybody that
was present and participated. I sympathized
with him because he was struggling with difficulties,
and so was I. Mr. Lincoln served with me
in the legislature in 1836, when we both retired;
and he subsided or became submerged, and he was
lost sight of as a public man for some years. In
1846, when Wilmot introduced his celebrated
proviso, and the Abolition tornado swept over the
country, Lincoln again turned up as a member of
Congress from the Sangamon district. I was then
in the Senate of the United States, and was glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
to welcome my old friend and companion. Whilst
in Congress, he distinguished himself by his opposition
to the Mexican War, taking the side of
the common enemy against his own country; and
when he returned home he found that the indignation
of the people followed him everywhere, and
he was again submerged or obliged to retire into
private life, forgotten by his former friends. He
came up again in 1854, just in time to make this
Abolition or Black Republican platform,&mdash;in company
with Giddings, Lovejoy, Chase, and Fred
Douglass,&mdash;for the Republican party to stand
upon.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Having formed this new party for the benefit
of deserters from Whiggery and deserters from
Democracy, and having laid down the Abolition
platform which I have read, Lincoln now takes
his stand and proclaims his Abolition doctrines.
Let me read a part of them. In his speech at
Springfield to the convention which nominated him
for the Senate he said:</p>

<p>“In my opinion, it will not cease until a crisis
shall have been reached and passed. ‘A house
divided against itself cannot stand.’ I believe this
government <i>cannot endure permanently half-slave
and half-free</i>. I do not expect the Union to be
dissolved,&mdash;I do not expect the house to fall,&mdash;<i>but
I do expect it will cease to be divided</i>. It will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
become all one thing or all the other. Either the
opponents of slavery <i>will arrest the further spread
of it</i>, and place it where the public mind shall
rest in the belief <i>that it is in the course of ultimate
extinction</i>, or its advocates <i>will push it
forward till it shall become alike lawful in
all the States</i>,&mdash;old as well as new, North
as well as South.” [<i>“Good,” “Good,” and
cheers.</i>]</p>

<p>I am delighted to hear you Black Republicans
say, “Good.” I have no doubt that doctrine expresses
your sentiments; and I will prove to you
now, if you will listen to me, that it is revolutionary
and destructive of the existence of this government.
Mr. Lincoln, in the extract from which I
have read, says that this government cannot endure
permanently in the same condition in which
it was made by its framers&mdash;divided into free and
slave States. He says that it has existed for about
seventy years thus divided, and yet he tells you
that it cannot endure permanently on the same
principles and in the same relative condition in
which our fathers made it. Why can it not exist
divided into free and slave States? Washington,
Jefferson, Franklin, Madison, Hamilton, Jay, and
the great men of that day made this government
divided into free States and slave States, and left
each State perfectly free to do as it pleased on
the subject of slavery. Why can it not exist on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
the same principles on which our fathers made it?
They knew when they framed the Constitution
that in a country as wide and broad as this, with
such a variety of climate, production, and interest,
the people necessarily required different laws and
institutions in different localities. They knew that
the laws and regulations which would suit the
granite hills of New Hampshire would be unsuited
to the rice plantations of South Carolina;
and they therefore provided that each State should
retain its own legislature and its own sovereignty,
with the full and complete power to do as
it pleased within its own limits, in all that was
local and not national. One of the reserved rights
of the States was the right to regulate the relations
between master and servant, on the slavery question.
At the time the Constitution was framed
there were thirteen States in the Union, twelve
of which were slaveholding States and one a free
State. Suppose this doctrine of uniformity
preached by Mr. Lincoln, that the States should
all be free or all be slave, had prevailed; and
what would have been the result? Of course,
the twelve slaveholding States would have overruled
the one free State; and slavery would have
been fastened by a constitutional provision on
every inch of the American republic, instead of
being left, as our fathers wisely left it, to each
State to decide for itself. Here I assert that uniformity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
in the local laws and institutions of the
different States is neither possible nor desirable.
If uniformity had been adopted when the government
was established, it must inevitably have been
the uniformity of slavery everywhere, or else the
uniformity of negro citizenship and negro equality
everywhere.</p>

<p>We are told by Lincoln that he is utterly opposed
to the Dred Scott decision, and will not submit
to it, for the reason that he says it deprives
the negro of the rights and privileges of citizenship.
That is the first and main reason which he
assigns for his warfare on the Supreme Court of
the United States and its decision. I ask you, Are
you in favor of conferring upon the negro the
rights and privileges of citizenship? Do you desire
to strike out of our State constitution that
clause which keeps slaves and free negroes out of
the State, and allow the free negroes to flow in,
and cover your prairies with black settlements?
Do you desire to turn this beautiful State into a
free negro colony, in order that when Missouri
abolishes slavery she can send one hundred thousand
emancipated slaves into Illinois, to become
citizens and voters, on an equality with yourselves?
If you desire negro citizenship, if you desire to
allow them to come into the State and settle with
the white man, if you desire them to vote on an
equality with yourselves, and to make them eligible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
to office, to serve on juries, and to adjudge your
rights, then support Mr. Lincoln and the Black
Republican party, who are in favor of the citizenship
of the negro. For one, I am opposed to
negro citizenship in any and every form. I believe
this government was made on the white basis.
I believe it was made by white men, for the benefit
of white men and their posterity forever; and I
am in favor of confining citizenship to white men,
men of European birth and descent, instead of conferring
it upon negroes, Indians, and other inferior
races.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln, following the example and lead
of all the little Abolition orators who go around
and lecture in the basements of schools and
churches, reads from the Declaration of Independence
that all men were created equal, and then
asks, How can you deprive a negro of that equality
which God and the Declaration of Independence
award to him? He and they maintain that negro
equality is guaranteed by the laws of God, and
that it is asserted in the Declaration of Independence.
If they think so, of course they have a right
to say so, and so vote. I do not question Mr. Lincoln’s
conscientious belief that the negro was made
his equal, and hence is his brother; but, for my
own part, I do not regard the negro as my equal,
and positively deny that he is my brother or any
kin to me whatever.... I do not believe that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
the Almighty ever intended the negro to be the
equal of the white man. If he did, he has been
a long time demonstrating the fact. For thousands
of years the negro has been a race upon
the earth; and during all that time, in all latitudes
and climates, wherever he has wandered or been
taken, he has been inferior to the race which he
has there met. He belongs to an inferior race,
and must always occupy an inferior position. I
do not hold that, because the negro is our inferior,
therefore he ought to be a slave. By no means can
such a conclusion be drawn from what I have said.
On the contrary, I hold that humanity and Christianity
both require that the negro shall have and
enjoy every right, every privilege, and every immunity
consistent with the safety of the society in
which he lives. On that point, I presume, there
can be no diversity of opinion. You and I are
bound to extend to our inferior and dependent
beings every right, every privilege, every facility
and immunity consistent with the public good.
The question then arises, What rights and privileges
are consistent with the public good? This
is a question which each State and each Territory
must decide for itself. Illinois has decided it for
herself. We have provided that the negro shall
not be a slave; and we have also provided that
he shall not be a citizen, but protect him in his
civil rights, in his life, his person, and his property,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
only depriving him of all political rights
whatsoever and refusing to put him on an equality
with the white man. That policy of Illinois is
satisfactory to the Democratic party and to me,
and if it were to the Republicans there would then
be no question upon the subject; but the Republicans
say that he ought to be made a citizen, and
when he becomes a citizen he becomes your equal,
with all your rights and privileges. They assert
the Dred Scott decision to be monstrous because
it denies that the negro is or can be a citizen under
the Constitution.</p>

<p>Now, I hold that Illinois had a right to abolish
and prohibit slavery as she did, and I hold that
Kentucky has the same right to continue and protect
slavery that Illinois had to abolish it. I hold
that New York had as much right to abolish slavery
as Virginia has to continue it, and that each
and every State of this Union is a sovereign power,
with the right to do as it pleases upon this question
of slavery and upon all its domestic institutions.
Slavery is not the only question which comes
up in this controversy. There is a far more important
one to you, and that is, What shall be done
with the free negro?... In relation to the policy
to be pursued toward the free negroes, we have
said that they shall not vote; whilst Maine, on
the other hand, has said that they shall vote.
Maine is a sovereign State, and has the power to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
regulate the qualifications of voters within her limits.
I would never consent to confer the right of
voting and of citizenship upon a negro, but still
I am not going to quarrel with Maine for differing
from me in opinion. Let Maine take care of
her own negroes, and fix the qualifications of her
own voters to suit herself, without interfering with
Illinois; and Illinois will not interfere with Maine.
So with the State of New York. She allows the
negro to vote provided he owns two hundred and
fifty dollars’ worth of property, but not otherwise.
While I would not make any distinction whatever
between a negro who held property and one who
did not, yet if the sovereign State of New York
chooses to make that distinction it is her business,
and not mine; and I will not quarrel with her for
it. She can do as she pleases on this question if she
minds her own business, and we will do the same
thing. Now, my friends, if we will only act conscientiously
and rigidly upon this great principle
of popular sovereignty, which guarantees to each
State and Territory the right to do as it pleases
on all things local and domestic instead of Congress
interfering, we will continue at peace one
with another. Why should Illinois be at war with
Missouri, or Kentucky with Ohio, or Virginia with
New York, merely because their institutions differ?
Our fathers intended that our institutions should
differ. They knew that the North and the South,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
having different climates, productions, and interests,
required different institutions. This doctrine
of Mr. Lincoln, of uniformity among the institutions
of the different States, is a new doctrine never
dreamed of by Washington, Madison, or the framers
of this government. Mr. Lincoln and the
Republican party set themselves up as wiser than
these men who made this government, which has
flourished for seventy years under the principle of
popular sovereignty, recognizing the right of each
State to do as it pleased. Under that principle,
we have grown from a nation of three or four
millions to a nation of about thirty millions of
people. We have crossed the Alleghany mountains
and filled up the whole Northwest, turning
the prairie into a garden, and building up churches
and schools, thus spreading civilization and Christianity
where before there was nothing but savage
barbarism. Under that principle we have become,
from a feeble nation, the most powerful on the
face of the earth; and, if we only adhere to that
principle, we can go forward increasing in territory,
in power, in strength, and in glory until the
Republic of America shall be the north star that
shall guide the friends of freedom throughout the
civilized world. And why can we not adhere to
the great principle of self-government upon which
our institutions were originally based? I believe
that this new doctrine preached by Mr. Lincoln<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
and his party will dissolve the Union if it succeeds.
They are trying to array all the Northern
States in one body against the South, to excite a
sectional war between the Free States and the
Slave States, in order that the one or the other may
be driven to the wall.</p>

<h2>LINCOLN-DOUGLAS DEBATE<br />

<span class="subhead">FIRST JOINT DEBATE, DELIVERED AT OTTAWA,
ILL., AUGUST 21, 1858</span></h2>

<h3><i>Lincoln’s Reply</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">My Fellow-Citizens</span>:&mdash;When a man hears
himself somewhat misrepresented, it provokes him,&mdash;at
least I find it so with myself; but when misrepresentation
becomes very gross and palpable it
is more apt to amuse him. The first thing I see
fit to notice is the fact that Judge Douglas alleges,
after running through the history of the old Democratic
and the old Whig parties, that Judge Trumbull
and myself made an arrangement in 1854 by
which I was to have the place of General Shields
in the United States Senate, and Judge Trumbull
was to have the place of Judge Douglas. Now
all I have to say upon that subject is that I think
no man&mdash;not even Judge Douglas&mdash;can prove it,
<i>because it is not true</i>. I have no doubt he is “conscientious”
in saying it. As to those resolutions
that he took such a length of time to read, as being
the platform of the Republican party in 1854,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
I say I never had anything to do with them; and
I think Trumbull never had. Judge Douglas cannot
show that either of us ever did have anything
to do with them. I believe this is true about those
resolutions: There was a call for a convention to
form a Republican party at Springfield; and I think
that my friend, Mr. Lovejoy, who is here upon
this stand, had a hand in it. I think this is true;
and I think, if he will remember accurately, he
will be able to recollect that he tried to get me
into it and I would not go in. I believe it is also
true that I went away from Springfield, when the
convention was in session, to attend court in Tazewell
County. It is true they did place my name,
though without authority, upon the committee, and
afterward wrote me to attend the meeting of the
committee; but I refused to do so, and I never
had anything to do with that organization. This
is the plain truth about all that matter of the
resolutions.</p>

<p>Now, about this story that Judge Douglas tells
of Trumbull bargaining to sell out the old Democratic
party, and Lincoln agreeing to sell out the
old Whig party, I have the means of <i>knowing</i>
about that; Judge Douglas cannot have; and I
know there is no substance to it whatever. Yet
I have no doubt he is “conscientious” about it.
I know that after Mr. Lovejoy got into the legislature
that winter he complained to me that I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
told all the old Whigs of his district that the old
Whig party was good enough for them, and some
of them voted against him because I told them so.
Now, I have no means of totally disproving such
charges as this which the Judge makes. A man
cannot prove a negative; but he has a right to
claim that, when a man makes an affirmative
charge, he must offer some proof to show the truth
of what he says. I certainly cannot introduce testimony
to show the negative about things; but I
have a right to claim that, if a man says he <i>knows</i>
a thing, then he must show <i>how he knows it</i>. I
always have a right to claim this, and it is not
satisfactory to me that he may be “conscientious”
on the subject.</p>

<p>Now, gentlemen, I hate to waste my time on
such things, but in regard to that general Abolition
tilt that Judge Douglas makes when he says that
I was engaged at that time in selling out and
Abolitionizing the old Whig party, I hope you will
permit me to read a part of a printed speech that
I made then at Peoria, which will show altogether
a different view of the position I took in that contest
of 1854. [<i>Voice: “Put on your specs.”</i>]
Yes, sir, I am obliged to do so; I am no longer
a young man:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“This is the <i>repeal</i> of the Missouri Compromise.
The foregoing history may not be precisely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
accurate in every particular; but I am sure it is
sufficiently so for all the uses I shall attempt to
make of it, and in it we have before us the chief
materials enabling us to correctly judge whether
the repeal of the Missouri Compromise is right or
wrong.</p>

<p>“I think, and shall try to show, that it is wrong,&mdash;wrong
in its direct effect, letting slavery into
Kansas and Nebraska,&mdash;and wrong in its prospective
principle, allowing it to spread to every
other part of the wide world where men can be
found inclined to take it.</p>

<p>“This <i>declared</i> indifference, but as I must think
covert real <i>zeal</i> for the spread of slavery, I cannot
but hate. I hate it because of the monstrous injustice
of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives
our republican example of its just influence
in the world; enables the enemies of free institutions,
with plausibility, to taunt us as hypocrites;
causes the real friends of freedom to doubt our
sincerity, and especially because it forces so many
really good men amongst ourselves into an open
war with the very fundamental principles of civil
liberty,&mdash;criticising the Declaration of Independence,
and insisting that there is no right principle
of action but <i>self-interest</i>.</p>

<p>“Before proceeding, let me say I think I have
no prejudice against the Southern people. They
are just what we would be in their situation. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
slavery did not now exist among them, they would
not introduce it. If it did now exist among us,
we should not instantly give it up. This I believe
of the masses North and South. Doubtless
there are individuals on both sides who would not
hold slaves under any circumstances; and others
who would gladly introduce slavery anew, if it
were out of existence. We know that some Southern
men do free their slaves, go North, and become
tip-top Abolitionists; while some Northern
ones go South, and become most cruel slavemasters.</p>

<p>“When Southern people tell us they are no more
responsible for the origin of slavery than we, I
acknowledge the fact. When it is said that the
institution exists, and that it is very difficult to
get rid of it in any satisfactory way, I can understand
and appreciate the saying. I surely will not
blame them for not doing what I should not know
how to do myself. If all earthly power were
given me, I should not know what to do as to
the existing institution. My first impulse would
be to free all the slaves, and send them to Liberia,&mdash;to
their own native land. But a moment’s reflection
would convince me that, whatever of high
hope (as I think there is) there may be in this in
the long run, its sudden execution is impossible. If
they were all landed there in a day, they would
all perish in the next ten days; and there are not
surplus shipping and surplus money enough in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
world to carry them there in many times ten days.
What then? Free them all, and keep them among
us as underlings? Is it quite certain that this betters
their condition? I think I would not hold
one in slavery, at any rate; yet the point is not
clear enough to me to denounce people upon.
What next? Free them, and make them politically
and socially our equals? My own feelings will
not admit of this; and if mine would, we well
know that those of the great mass of white people
will not. Whether this feeling accords with justice
and sound judgment is not the sole question, if
indeed it is any part of it. A universal feeling,
whether well or ill-founded, cannot be safely disregarded.
We cannot make them equals. It does
seem to me that systems of gradual emancipation
might be adopted; but for their tardiness in this I
will not undertake to judge our brethren of the
South.</p>

<p>“When they remind us of their constitutional
rights, I acknowledge them, not grudgingly, but
fully and fairly; and I would give them any legislation
for the reclaiming of their fugitives which
should not, in its stringency, be more likely to carry
a free man into slavery than our ordinary criminal
laws are to hang an innocent one.</p>

<p>“But all this, to my judgment, furnishes no
more excuse for permitting slavery to go into our
own free territory than it would for reviving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
African slave-trade by law. The law which forbids
the bringing of slaves from Africa, and that
which has so long forbidden the taking of them
to Nebraska, can hardly be distinguished on any
moral principle; and the repeal of the former
could find quite as plausible excuses as that of the
latter.”</p></blockquote>

<p>I have reason to know that Judge Douglas
<i>knows</i> that I said this. I think he has the answer
here to one of the questions he put to me. I do
not mean to allow him to catechize me unless he
pays back for it in kind. I will not answer questions
one after another, unless he reciprocates; but
as he has made this inquiry, and I have answered
it before, he has got it without my getting anything
in return. He has got my answer on the
fugitive-slave law.</p>

<p>Now, gentlemen, I don’t want to read at any
great length; but this is the true complexion of all
I have ever said in regard to the institution of
slavery and the black race. This is the whole
of it; and anything that argues me into his idea
of perfect social and political equality with the
negro is but a specious and fantastic arrangement
of words, by which a man can prove a horse-chestnut
to be a chestnut horse. I will say here, while
upon this subject, that I have no purpose, either
directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe
I have no lawful right to do so, and I have
no inclination to do so. I have no purpose to introduce
political and social equality between the
white and the black races. There is a physical
difference between the two which, in my judgment,
will probably forever forbid their living together
upon the footing of perfect equality; and, inasmuch
as it becomes a necessity that there must be
a difference, I as well as Judge Douglas am in
favor of the race to which I belong having the
superior position. I have never said anything to
the contrary, but I hold that, notwithstanding all
this, there is no reason in the world why the negro
is not entitled to all the natural rights enumerated
in the Declaration of Independence,&mdash;the right to
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. I hold
that he is as much entitled to these as the white
man. I agree with Judge Douglas he is not my
equal in many respects,&mdash;certainly not in color,
perhaps not in moral or intellectual endowment.
But <i>in the right to eat the bread, without the leave
of anybody else, which his own hand earns, he is
my equal and the equal of Judge Douglas, and the
equal of every living man</i>.</p>

<p>Now I pass on to consider one or two more of
these little follies. The Judge is wofully at fault
about his early friend Lincoln being a “grocery-keeper.”
I don’t think that it would be a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
sin if I had been; but he is mistaken. Lincoln
never kept a grocery anywhere in the world. It
is true that Lincoln did work the latter part of
one winter in a little still-house up at the head of
a hollow. And so I think my friend, the Judge,
is equally at fault when he charges me at the time
when I was in Congress of having opposed our
soldiers who were fighting in the Mexican War.
The Judge did not make his charge very distinctly;
but I tell you what he can prove, by referring to
the record. You remember I was an Old Whig;
and whenever the Democratic party tried to get
me to vote that the war had been righteously begun
by the President, I would not do it. But
whenever they asked for any money or land-warrants
or anything to pay the soldiers there, during
all that time, I gave the same vote that Judge
Douglas did. You can think as you please as to
whether that was consistent. Such is the truth;
and the Judge has the right to make all he can
out of it. But when he, by a general charge, conveys
the idea that I withheld supplies from the
soldiers who were fighting in the Mexican War,
or did anything else to hinder the soldiers, he is,
to say the least, grossly and altogether mistaken,
as a consultation of the records will prove to him.</p>

<p>As I have not used up so much of my time as
I had supposed, I will dwell a little longer upon
one or two of these minor topics upon which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
Judge has spoken. He has read from my speech
in Springfield in which I say that “a house divided
against itself cannot stand.” Does the Judge say
it <i>can</i> stand? I don’t know whether he does or
not. The Judge does not seem to be attending to
me just now, but I would like to know if it is his
opinion that a house divided against itself <i>can
stand</i>. If he does, then there is a question of
veracity, not between him and me, but between the
Judge and an authority of a somewhat higher
character.</p>

<p>Now, my friends, I ask your attention to this
matter for the purpose of saying something seriously.
I know that the Judge may readily enough
agree with me that the maxim which was put forth
by the Savior is true, but he may allege that I
misapply it; and the Judge has a right to urge that
in my application I do misapply it, and then I have
a right to show that I do <i>not</i> misapply it. When
he undertakes to say that, because I think this nation
so far as the question of slavery is concerned
will all become one thing or all the other, I am
in favor of bringing about a dead uniformity in
the various States in all their institutions, he argues
erroneously. The great variety of the local institutions
in the States, springing from differences in
the soil, differences in the face of the country, and
in the climate, are bonds of union. They do not
make “a house divided against itself,” but they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
make a house united. If they produce in one section
of the country what is called for by the wants
of another section, and this other section can supply
the wants of the first, they are not matters of
discord, but bonds of union,&mdash;true bonds of union.
But can this question of slavery be considered as
among <i>these</i> varieties in the institutions of the
country? I leave it to you to say whether, in the
history of our government, this institution of slavery
has not always failed to be a bond of union,
and on the contrary been an apple of discord and
an element of division in the house. I ask you to
consider whether, so long as the moral constitution
of men’s minds shall continue to be the same, after
this generation and assemblage shall sink into the
grave and another race shall arise with the same
moral and intellectual development we have,&mdash;whether,
if that institution is standing in the same
irritating position in which is now is, it will not
continue an element of division?</p>

<p>If so, then I have a right to say that, in regard
to this question, the Union is a house divided
against itself; and when the Judge reminds me that
I have often said to him that the institution of slavery
has existed for eighty years in some States, and
yet it does not exist in some others, I agree to the
fact, and I account for it by looking at the position
in which our fathers originally placed it,&mdash;restricting
it from the new Territories where it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
had not gone, and legislating to cut off its source
by the abrogation of the slave trade, thus putting
the seal of legislation <i>against its spread</i>. The public
mind <i>did</i> rest in the belief that it was in the
course of ultimate extinction. But lately, I think,&mdash;and
in this I charge nothing on the Judge’s motives,&mdash;lately,
I think that he, and those acting
with him, have placed that institution on a new
basis, which looks to the <i>perpetuity and nationalization
of slavery</i>. And while it is placed upon
this new basis, I say and I have said that I believe
we shall not have peace upon the question until
the opponents of slavery arrest the further spread
of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest
in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate
extinction; or, on the other hand, that its advocates
will push it forward until it shall become
alike lawful in all the States, old as well as new,
North as well as South. Now I believe, if we could
arrest the spread and place it where Washington
and Jefferson and Madison placed it, it <i>would be</i>
in the course of ultimate extinction, and the public
mind would, as for eighty years past, believe
that it was in the course of ultimate extinction.
The crisis would be past, and the institution might
be let alone for a hundred years&mdash;if it should live
so long&mdash;in the States where it exists, yet it would
be going out of existence in the way best for both
the black and the white races.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
[<i>A voice: “Then do you repudiate Popular
Sovereignty?”</i>]</p>

<p>Well, then, let us talk about popular sovereignty.
What is Popular Sovereignty? Is it the
right of the people to have slavery or not have it,
as they see fit, in the Territories? I will state&mdash;and
I have an able man to watch me&mdash;my understanding
is that Popular Sovereignty, as now applied
to the question of slavery, does allow the
people of a Territory to <i>have</i> slavery if they want
to, but does not allow them <i>not</i> to have it if they
do not want it. I do not mean that, if this vast
concourse of people were in a Territory of the
United States, any one of them would be obliged
to have a slave if he did not want one; but I do
say that, as I understand the Dred Scott decision,
if any one man wants slaves all the rest have no
way of keeping that one man from holding them.</p>

<p>When I made my speech at Springfield, of which
the Judge complains and from which he quotes, I
really was not thinking of the things which he
ascribes to me at all. I had no thought in the
world that I was doing anything to bring about a
war between the Free and Slave States. I had no
thought in the world that I was doing anything to
bring about a political and social equality of the
black and white races. It never occurred to me
that I was doing anything or favoring anything
to reduce to a dead uniformity all the local institutions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
of the various States. But I must say, in
all fairness to him, if he thinks I am doing something
which leads to these bad results, it is none
the better that I did not mean it. It is just as
fatal to the country, if I have any influence in
producing it, whether I intend it or not. But can
it be true that placing this institution upon the
original basis&mdash;the basis upon which our fathers
placed it&mdash;can have any tendency to set the Northern
and the Southern States at war with one another,
or that it can have any tendency to make the
people of Vermont raise sugar-cane because they
raise it in Louisiana, or that it can compel the
people of Illinois to cut pine logs on the Grand
Prairie, where they will not grow, because they cut
pine logs in Maine, where they do grow? The
Judge says this is a new principle started in regard
to this question. Does the Judge claim that he is
working on the plan of the founders of the government?
I think he says in some of his speeches&mdash;indeed,
I have one here now&mdash;that he saw evidence
of a policy to allow slavery to be south of
a certain line, while north of it it should be excluded;
and he saw an indisposition on the part
of the country to stand upon that policy, and
therefore he set about studying the subject upon
<i>original principles</i>, and upon <i>original principles</i> he
got up the Nebraska bill! I am fighting it upon
these “original principles,”&mdash;fighting it in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
Jeffersonian, Washingtonian, and Madisonian
fashion.</p>

<p>Now, my friends, I wish you to attend for a
little while to one or two other things in that
Springfield speech. My main object was to show,
so far as my humble ability was capable of showing,
to the people of this country what I believed
was the truth,&mdash;that there was a <i>tendency</i>, if not
a conspiracy, among those who have engineered
this slavery question for the last four or five years,
to make slavery perpetual and universal in this nation.
Having made that speech principally for
that object, after arranging the evidences that I
thought tended to prove my proposition, I concluded
with this bit of comment:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“We cannot absolutely know that these exact
adaptations are the results of pre-concert; but,
when we see a lot of framed timbers, different portions
of which we know have been gotten out at
different times and places, and by different
workmen,&mdash;Stephen [Senator Douglas], Franklin
[President Pierce], Roger [Chief Justice Taney],
and James [President Buchanan], for instance,&mdash;and
when we see these timbers joined together, and
see they exactly make the frame of a house or a
mill, all the tenons and mortises exactly fitting, and
all the lengths and proportions of the different
pieces exactly adapted to their respective places,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
and not a piece too many or too few,&mdash;not omitting
even the scaffolding,&mdash;or if a single piece be
lacking, we see the place in the frame exactly fitted
and prepared to yet bring such piece in,&mdash;in such
a case we feel it impossible not to believe that
Stephen, and Franklin, and Roger, and James, all
understood one another from the beginning, and
all worked upon a common plan or draft drawn
before the first blow was struck.”</p></blockquote>

<p>When my friend, Judge Douglas, came to Chicago
on the 9th of July, this speech having been
delivered on the 16th of June, he made an
harangue there in which he took hold of this speech
of mine, showing that he had carefully read it;
and, while he paid no attention to <i>this</i> matter at
all, but complimented me as being a “kind, amiable,
and intelligent gentleman,” notwithstanding
I had said this, he goes on and deduces, or draws
out, from my speech this tendency of mine to set
the States at war with one another, to make all the
institutions uniform, and set the niggers and white
people to marry together. Then, as the Judge had
complimented me with these pleasant titles, (I
must confess to my weakness) I was a little
“taken”; for it came from a great man. I was
not very much accustomed to flattery, and it came
the sweeter to me. I was rather like the Hoosier
with the gingerbread, when he said he reckoned he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
loved it better than any other man, and got less
of it. As the Judge had so flattered me, I could
not make up my mind that he meant to deal unfairly
with me. So I went to work to show him
that he misunderstood the whole scope of my
speech, and that I really never intended to set the
people at war with one another. As an illustration,
the next time I met him, which was at Springfield,
I used this expression, that I claimed no right
under the Constitution, nor had I any inclination,
to enter into the Slave States and interfere with
the institutions of slavery. He says upon that:
Lincoln will not enter into the Slave States, but
will go to the banks of the Ohio, on this side, and
shoot over! He runs on, step by step, in the
horse-chestnut style of argument, until in the
Springfield speech he says, “Unless he shall be
successful in firing his batteries until he shall have
extinguished slavery in all the States, the Union
shall be dissolved.” Now I don’t think that was
exactly the way to treat “a kind, amiable, intelligent
gentleman.” I know if I had asked the
Judge to show when or where it was I had said
that, if I didn’t succeed in firing into the Slave
States until slavery should be extinguished, the
Union should be dissolved, he could not have
shown it. I understand what he would do. He
would say, “I don’t mean to quote from you, but
this was the <i>result</i> of what you say.” But I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
the right to ask, and I do ask now, Did you not
put it in such a form that an ordinary reader or
listener would take it as an expression <i>from me</i>?</p>

<p>In a speech at Springfield, on the night of the
17th, I thought I might as well attend to my own
business a little; and I recalled his attention as well
as I could to this charge of conspiracy to nationalize
slavery. I called his attention to the fact that
he had acknowledged in my hearing twice that he
had carefully read the speech; and, in the language
of the lawyers, as he had twice read the speech
and still had put in no plea or answer, I took a
default on him. I insisted that I had a right then
to renew that charge of conspiracy. Ten days
afterwards I met the Judge at Clinton,&mdash;that is to
say, I was on the ground, but not in the discussion,&mdash;and
heard him make a speech. Then he
comes in with his plea to this charge, for the first
time; and his plea when put in, as well as I can
recollect it, amounted to this: That he never had
any talk with Judge Taney or the President of
the United States with regard to the Dred Scott
decision before it was made; I (Lincoln) ought
to know that the man who makes a charge without
knowing it to be true falsifies as much as he who
knowingly tells a falsehood; and, lastly, that he
would pronounce the whole thing a falsehood; but
he would make no personal application of the
charge of falsehood, not because of any regard for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
the “kind, amiable, intelligent gentleman,” but
because of his own personal self-respect! I have
understood since then (but [turning to Judge
Douglas] will not hold the Judge to it if he is not
willing) that he has broken through the “self-respect,”
and has got to saying the thing <i>out</i>. The
Judge nods to me that it is so. It is fortunate for
me that I can keep as good-humored as I do, when
the Judge acknowledges that he has been trying
to make a question of veracity with me. I know
the Judge is a great man, while I am only a small
man; but I feel that I have got him. I demur to
that plea. I waive all objections that it was not
filed till after default was taken, and demur to it
upon the merits. What if Judge Douglas never
did talk with Chief Justice Taney and the President
before the Dred Scott decision was made:
does it follow that he could not have had as perfect
an understanding without talking as with it?
I am not disposed to stand upon my legal advantage.
I am disposed to take his denial as being
like an answer in chancery, that he neither had any
knowledge, information, nor belief in the existence
of such a conspiracy. I am disposed to take
his answer as being as broad as though he had put
it in these words. And now, I ask, even if he had
done so, have not I a right to <i>prove it on him</i>, and
to offer the evidence of more than two witnesses,
by whom to prove it; and if the evidence proves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
the existence of the conspiracy, does his broad answer
denying all knowledge, information, or belief,
disturb the fact? It can only show that he was
<i>used</i> by conspirators, and was not a <i>leader</i> of them.</p>

<p>Now, in regard to his reminding me of the
moral rule that persons who tell what they do not
know to be true, falsify as much as those who
knowingly tell falsehoods. I remember the rule,
and it must be borne in mind that in what I have
read to you, I do not say that I know such a conspiracy
to exist. To that I reply, I believe it. If
the Judge says that I do not believe it, then he
says what he does not know, and falls within his
own rule that he who asserts a thing which he
does not know to be true, falsifies as much as he
who knowingly tells a falsehood. I want to call
your attention to a little discussion on that branch
of the case, and the evidence which brought my
mind to the conclusion which I expressed as my
belief. If, in arraying that evidence, I had stated
anything which was false or erroneous, it needed
but that Judge Douglas should point it out, and
I would have taken it back with all the kindness
in the world. I do not deal in that way. If I have
brought forward anything not a fact, if he will
point it out, it will not even ruffle me to take it
back. But if he will not point out anything erroneous
in the evidence, is it not rather for him
to show by a comparison of the evidence that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
have reasoned falsely, than to call the “kind, amiable,
intelligent gentleman” a liar? If I have
reasoned to a false conclusion, it is the vocation
of an able debater to show by argument that I have
wandered to an erroneous conclusion.</p>

<p>I want to ask your attention to a portion of the
Nebraska bill which Judge Douglas has quoted:
“It being the true intent and meaning of this Act
not to legislate slavery into any Territory or State,
nor to exclude it therefrom, but to leave the people
thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their
domestic institutions in their own way, subject only
to the Constitution of the United States.” Thereupon
Judge Douglas and others began to argue in
favor of “Popular Sovereignty,”&mdash;the right of the
people to have slaves if they wanted them, and to
exclude slavery if they did not want them. “But,”
said, in substance, a Senator from Ohio (Mr.
Chase, I believe), “we more than suspect that
you do not mean to allow the people to exclude
slavery if they wish to; and if you do mean it,
accept an amendment which I propose expressly
authorizing the people to exclude slavery.” I believe
I have the amendment here before me which
was offered, and under which the people of the
Territory, through their proper representatives,
might, if they saw fit, prohibit the existence of slavery
therein. And now I state it as a <i>fact</i>, to be
taken back if there is any mistake about it, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
Judge Douglas and those acting with him <i>voted
that amendment down</i>. I now think that those
men who voted it down had a <i>real reason</i> for doing
so. They know what that reason was. It
looks to us, since we have seen the Dred Scott decision
pronounced, holding that “under the Constitution”
the people cannot exclude slavery&mdash;I say
it looks to outsiders, poor, simple, “amiable, intelligent
gentlemen,” as though the niche was left as
a place to put that Dred Scott decision in,&mdash;a niche
which would have been spoiled by adopting the
amendment. And now I say again, if <i>this</i> was not
the reason, it will avail the judge much more to
calmly and good-humoredly point out to these people
what that <i>other</i> reason was for voting the
amendment down than swelling himself up to vociferate
that he may be provoked to call somebody
a liar.</p>

<p>Again, there is in that same quotation from
the Nebraska bill this clause: “It being the true
intent and meaning of this bill not to legislate slavery
into any Territory or <i>State</i>.” I have always
been puzzled to know what business the word
“State” had in that connection. Judge Douglas
knows. He put it there. He knows what he put
it there for. We outsiders cannot say what he put
it there for. The law they were passing was not
about States, and was not making provision for
States. What was it placed there for? After seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
the Dred Scott decision, which holds that the
people cannot exclude slavery from a <i>Territory</i>, if
another Dred Scott decision shall come, holding
that they cannot exclude it from a <i>State</i>, we shall
discover that when the word was originally put
there it was in view of something which was to
come in due time; we shall see that it was the
<i>other half</i> of something. I now say again, if there
is any different reason for putting it there, Judge
Douglas, in a good-humored way, without calling
anybody a liar, <i>can tell what the reason was</i>.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Now, my friends, I have but one branch of the
subject, in the little time I have left, to which to
call your attention; and, as I shall come to a close
at the end of that branch, it is probable that I shall
not occupy quite all the time allotted to me. Although
on these questions I would like to talk
twice as long as I have, I could not enter upon
another head and discuss it properly without running
over my time. I ask the attention of the
people here assembled and elsewhere to the course
that Judge Douglas is pursuing every day as bearing
upon this question of making slavery national.
Not going back to the records, but taking the
speeches he makes, the speeches he made yesterday
and day before, and makes constantly all over the
country,&mdash;I ask your attention to them. In the
first place, what is necessary to make the institution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
national? Not war. There is no danger that the
people of Kentucky will shoulder their muskets,
and, with a young nigger stuck on every bayonet,
march into Illinois and force them upon us. There
is no danger of our going over there and making
war upon them. Then what is necessary for the
nationalization of slavery? It is simply the next
Dred Scott decision. It is merely for the Supreme
Court to decide that no <i>State</i> under the Constitution
can exclude it, just as they have already decided
that under the Constitution neither Congress
nor the Territorial legislature can do it. When
that is decided and acquiesced in, the whole thing
is done. This being true, and this being the way,
as I think, that slavery is to be made national, let
us consider what Judge Douglas is doing every day
to that end. In the first place, let us see what
influence he is exerting on public sentiment. In
this and like communities, public sentiment is
everything. With public sentiment, nothing can
fail: without it, nothing can succeed. Consequently,
he who molds public sentiment goes deeper
than he who enacts statutes or pronounces decisions.
He makes statutes and decisions possible or impossible
to be executed. This must be borne in mind,
as also the additional fact that Judge Douglas is
a man of vast influence, so great that it is enough
for many men to profess to believe anything when
they once find out that Judge Douglas professes to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
believe it. Consider also the attitude he occupies
at the head of a large party,&mdash;a party which he
claims has a majority of all the voters in the
country.</p>

<p>This man sticks to a decision which forbids the
people of a Territory to exclude slavery, and he
does so not because he says it is right in itself,&mdash;he
does not give any opinion on that,&mdash;but because
it has been <i>decided by the court</i>; and, being decided
by the court, he is, and you are, bound to take it
in your political action as law,&mdash;not that he judges
at all of its merits, but because a decision of the
court is to him a “Thus saith the Lord.” He
places it on that ground alone, and you will bear
in mind that thus committing himself unreservedly
to this decision <i>commits him to the next one</i> just
as firmly as to this. He did not commit himself
on account of the merit or demerit of the decision,
but it is a “Thus saith the Lord.” The next
decision, as much as this, will be a “Thus saith
the Lord.” There is nothing that can divert or
turn him away from this decision. It is nothing
that I point out to him that his great prototype,
General Jackson, did not believe in the binding
force of decisions. It is nothing to him that Jefferson
did not so believe. I have said that I have
often heard him approve of Jackson’s course in
disregarding the decision of the Supreme Court
pronouncing a national bank constitutional. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
says I did not hear him say so. He denies the
accuracy of my recollection. I say he ought to
know better than I; but I will make no question
about this thing, though it still seems to me that
I heard him say it twenty times. I will tell him,
though, that he now claims to stand on the Cincinnati
platform, which affirms that Congress cannot
charter a national bank, in the teeth of that
old standing decision that Congress can charter a
bank. And I remind him of another piece of history
on the question of respect for judicial decisions,
and it is a piece of Illinois history, belonging
to a time when a large party to which Judge
Douglas belonged were displeased with a decision
of the Supreme Court of Illinois because they had
decided that a Governor could not remove a Secretary
of State. You will find the whole story in
Ford’s <i>History of Illinois</i>, and I know that Judge
Douglas will not deny that he was then in favor
of overslaughing that decision by the mode of adding
five new judges, so as to vote down the four
old ones. Not only so, but it ended in the Judge’s
sitting down on the very bench as one of the five
new Judges to break down the four old ones. It
was in this way precisely that he got his title of
judge. Now, when the Judge tells me that men
appointed conditionally to sit as members of a
court will have to be catechised beforehand upon
some subject, I say, “You know, Judge; you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
tried it.” When he says a court of this kind will
lose the confidence of all men, will be prostituted
and disgraced by such a proceeding, I say, “You
know best, Judge; you have been through the
mill.”</p>

<p>But I cannot shake Judge Douglas’s teeth loose
from the Dred Scott decision. Like some obstinate
animal (I mean no disrespect) that will hang
on when he has once got his teeth fixed, you may
cut off a leg or you may tear away an arm, still
he will not relax his hold. And so I may point
out to the Judge, and say that he is bespattered all
over, from the beginning of his political life to
the present time, with attacks upon judicial decisions;
I may cut off limb after limb of his public
record, and strive to wrench from him a single
dictum of the court,&mdash;yet I cannot divert him from
it. He hangs to the last to the Dred Scott decision.
These things show there is a purpose strong
as death and eternity for which he adheres to this
decision, and for which he will adhere to all other
decisions of the same court. [<i>A voice: “Give us
something besides Dred Scott.”</i>] Yes; no doubt
you want to hear something that don’t hurt.</p>

<p>Now, having spoken of the Dred Scott decision,
one more word and I am done. Henry Clay, my
beau-ideal of a statesman, the man for whom I
fought all my humble life,&mdash;Henry Clay once said
of a class of men who would repress all tendencies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
to liberty and ultimate emancipation, that they
must, if they would do this, go back to the era of
our independence and muzzle the cannon which
thunders its annual joyous return; they must blow
out the moral lights around us; they must penetrate
the human soul and eradicate there the love
of liberty; and then, and not till then, could they
perpetuate slavery in this country! To my thinking,
Judge Douglas is, by his example and vast
influence, doing that very thing in this community
when he says that the negro has nothing in the
Declaration of Independence. Henry Clay plainly
understood the contrary. Judge Douglas is going
back to the era of our Revolution, and to the
extent of his ability muzzling the cannon which
thunders its annual joyous return. When he invites
any people, willing to have slavery, to establish
it, he is blowing out the moral lights around
us. When he says he “cares not whether slavery
is voted down or voted up,”&mdash;that it is a
sacred right of self-government,&mdash;he is, in my
judgment, penetrating the human soul, and eradicating
the light of reason and the love of liberty
in this American people. And now I will only
say that when, by all these means and appliances,
Judge Douglas shall succeed in bringing public
sentiment to an exact accordance with his own
views,&mdash;when these vast assemblages shall echo
back all these sentiments,&mdash;when they shall come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
to repeat his views and to avow his principles, and
to say all that he says on these mighty questions,&mdash;then
it needs only the formality of the second Dred
Scott decision, which he indorses in advance, to
make slavery alike lawful in all the States, old as
well as new, North as well as South.</p>
